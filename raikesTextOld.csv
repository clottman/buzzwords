,"Students in the Jeffrey S. Raikes School live in the ,, in the heart of UNL's city campus, across from Broyhill Fountain and the Nebraska Union. 
                
              Through a gift from Carole and Ed McVaney in honor of her mother Esther Kauffman, this beautiful new building lets students live and learn in an environment that supports their vibrant academic community. "
,"The Great Hall, meeting rooms and study rooms let students settle in for spur-of-the-moment study sessions, have workshops and presentations, find a quiet place to sit with a laptop and answer e-mail or finish a report, or watch a movie, have an Xbox 360 tournament or a latenight snack feast.
                   
                   Some classes are in Kauffman, but others are outside, across campus, giving a mix of convenience (run downstairs to a 7 a.m. meeting in sweats) and expansiveness (meet classmates at CBA, for business class, play Frisbee football in the Union greenspace, or head off to the Rec Center for pick-up basketball).                   "
,"Classmates in the Raikes School quickly become friends, collaborators and teammates; with the same interests and desires to be leaders in the business and IT industry, the common bond. "

Speedway Motors is America's Oldest Speed ShopÂ® and has been a trusted source for specialty rodding and racing products and friendly expert advice for more than 60 years."
,"
Founded in 1952 by ""Speedy"" Bill Smith â€“ a racer and street rodder himself â€“ Speedway Motors has grown from a one-man operation to become the world's largest manufacturer, distributor and retailer of street rod and racing products. Our industry-leading fast delivery is the result of same-day shipping from our state-of-the-art, centrally located 500,000 sq. ft. headquarters. Speedway Motors size offers customers unmatched product selection and low pricing, while our excellent technical support and customer service have made us a recognized leader in the rodding and racing industries."
,"
Speedway Motors sells over 75,000 products to millions of customers on ,.  With such a broad array of products, ensuring that potential customers can find our products when conducting a web search is extremely important.  The traditional approach to solving this problem is a multi-billion dollar industry â€“ Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  This approach relies in part on manually creating and curating landing pages of products such that the pages are highly ranked by search engines for relevant phrases and contain groupings of products that are useful for consumers.  This approach has several limitations; i) it is not feasible to apply this approach to a site like SpeedwayMotors.com that has thousands of products and ii) the technical nature of our product means that an SEO specialist would require domain specific knowledge to create a page (for example, it doesn't make sense to create a landing page containing a radiator for a Small Block Chevy engine and a pair of fluffy dice)."
,"
We need your help to solve this problem.  Our vision for the 2012-13 Design Studio/Speedway Motors project is to solve this problem by building a linguistic analysis algorithm capable of parsing the content on SpeedwayMotors.com and building content rich, landing pages that help us deliver the best possible user experience to our customers."
,"
 The most commonly used linguistic modeling software is the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for Python.  The linguistic analysis will be developed in , and will include , and ,."
,"
The remainder of the project will be implemented using a standard Microsoft development stack including  "

At Speedway, our development teams also utilize , for bug/issue tracking, , (dVCS) for source control and , for project management.  Our preference is for the Design Studio team to use these products alongside our developers.

Firethorn Golf Club is Nebraska's only Pete Dye designed golf course. The facility opened in 1986 to rave reviews. The 18-hole championship course is one of the top rated courses in the Midwest. People that love the game of golf love to play Firethorn.  Firethorn is a golf club - not a country club.  Our core business is golf. We strive to do two things really well: 1) offer a great golf experience; and 2) reward our members with an inviting atmosphere where they can enjoy the best food in Lincoln."
,"
It is time to bring the game of golf into the 21st century. Almost all the innovation in this sport surrounds the equipment itself - how to make the ball go further with more accuracy. Our overarching objective is to make the game of golf more fun and appealing to today's technologically savvy society. Our goal, then, is to make Firethorn Golf Club THE place to be in private golf accommodations in Lincoln.  Successful implementation of this project will give Firethorn another competitive advantage in a key demographic age group (25 - 40)."

We want to work with a highly creative and talented group of students to achieve multiple business objectives as follows:"
,"
Students are expected to be innovative and to deliver the above in a final user format by the end of the spring semester 2013.  We envision numerous beta runs that will allow for user input throughout the development process.  Students will be encouraged to visit the course and restaurant to gain insight into the unique culture of Firethorn.  Students will need to work with Firespring to implement a seamless user experience with a completely new website.  At the same time, the website development (done by Firespring) will allow for a portal for member interface with Crescent (Firethorn's point of sale and integrated accounting system)."

Pen-Link, Ltd., is a Lincoln-based business that creates and sells software and services, predominantly but not exclusively to law enforcement agencies, to enable the collection and analysis of both live and historic communications data and content for both telephonic (circuit-switched) and Internet (packet-switched) networks. The company started in 1986 with a primary focus on helping local police departments automate the analysis of data from pen registers, but has evolved over time and with the passing of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (""CALEA"") in 1994 into a much more comprehensive solution for automating the collection and analysis of communications data and content from court-ordered historic telephone and internet service provider records, as well as lawful communication interception (wire taps and pen registers), of both telephone and Internet accounts. Reference materials can be found at the following locations:"

Pen-Link's core customer base is comprised predominantly of federal law enforcement agencies - e.g. Drug Enforcement Agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, United States Secret Service, United States Marshals, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, among others; as well as State and larger city law enforcement agencies - e.g. various states' ""bureaus of investigation"" or ""state patrols"" or ""state police departments"" and large city police departments. These agencies are predominantly larger, relatively well-funded agencies accustomed and able to afford large capital purchases of software systems. Average system purchases would be in the high tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"
,"
Management at Pen-Link believes the company has a significant opportunity to broaden its current market, as well as penetrate completely new markets, by developing a cloud-based, software-as-a-service offering and targeting smaller law enforcement agencies and non-law enforcement, ""civilian"" investigators who may have a need to collect and analyze historic communications data and content as part of their routine investigations. Two primary problems faced by these two groups preventing them from taking advantage of Pen-Link's current offering of software and services are 1) these groups cannot afford Pen-Link's current offering, and 2) these groups do not have the expertise, both in the processes of obtaining subpoenaed and court-ordered communications data, and in the analysis of the data once obtained. The envisioned solution to these problems is a system that will aid smaller law enforcement agency and civilian users in requesting a limited set of subpoenaed and court-ordered communications data from systems providers, load the returned data into our system, and provide a limited set of analysis functionality at a reduced price point â€“ likely on a pay-for-usage model â€“ via a web app."
,"
We believe that in order to make this a successful project, we should focus the Design Studio team on a few steps of the workflow. Specifically, we would like the Design Studio team to focus on the PICASO web front end and the integration with the carriers, rather than the steps of the workflow that integrate PICASO with the existing PLX system. In specific:"
,"
 PLX is written in C# with an Oracle backend, therefore the PLX API integration must be a C# web service. We are open to discussing the specific technologies used to create the website and backend. We currently feel that Amazon EC2, S3, etc., makes the most sense as the cloud provider for this project; however, we are open to other ideas if the Design Studio team feels another service provider would have advantages.

,"
At State Studios, we believe that the most valuable commodity is time.  Ask any professional trader or individual investor and they will tell you it does not matter whether you are making a trade on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange or from the comfort of your living room, time is an investor's most valuable resource."
,"
Mark Suleiman, the Managing Principal of State Studios, learned this lesson very early through his experience starting the Shark Fund.  In January 2009, Mark opened the Shark Fund Investment Club.  The Fund traded using the unique methodology of 'predatory trading' developed by Suleiman.  The balance of the Fund doubled within four months.  After three years, and nearly a four hundred percent return on principle since the inception of the Fund, Mark chose to start a hedge fund.  After completing a successful round of investment, Suleiman successfully started his hedge fund in the Summer of 2012. In August 2012, the Wall Street Journal named Suleiman the youngest hedge fund manager ever."
,"
The success of the Shark Fund was largely based on the early decision Mark made to hire freelance software developers to develop 'The Widget'; a basic tool and infrastructure for the collection, analysis and storage of financial data.  After finding that other retail and institutional traders wanted access to the same technology, Suleiman launched State Studios; a financial software development startup based in Lincoln.
"
,"
Current financial tools are very esoteric and only marginally useful for discovering and analyzing real-time events.  For instance, there are no good financial tools that analyze trending tweets and other social activity in a specific area.  Additionally, there is currently no way to see historical events for a particular commodity or market moving topic at any location more specific than a regional focus."
,"
We want to challenge Raikes students to envision the future and adoption of financial data delivery.  We want our Design Studio team members to build MarketBoard.   MarketBoard was born out of the idea of a 30-second trade. Using a proprietary aggregation technology we call Trendr, users are able to track updates relevant to their portfolios and make trades without ever leaving MarketBoard."
,"
Raikes students will be asked to embrace a multi-data analysis development; creating features on a platform for visualizing and analyzing market impact scenarios; taking the components of a real-time mapping of financial data and applying analysis tools, exposure to the sales, marketing, and branding of a product using a series of new technologies including location-based systems to bring innovation to an industry with a deficit of new products and services.

Hudl is the result when you mix three Raikes School graduates, a passion for Nebraska football, and a bunch of people not afraid to unleash their inner geek on the world of sports. Started by 3 members of Raikes cohort '01, we're now a group of 60 young people who aren't afraid to work hard or play hard. We help coaches and athletes prepare smarter and faster by connecting teams around the information they need to win. Hudl is used by a third of the NFL, over half of Division I, and two out of very 3 high schools in the country - over 10,000 organizations and growing. While football is our biggest market, we work with over 20 sports and help thousands of basketball, volleyball, and other teams as well. If you want to know what makes us tick, check out ,."

Football coaches demand more and more of their film. No longer does the concept of a ""film room"" apply. They expect to watch their film immediately after practice, sitting on the couch after putting the kids to bed, or on the bus ride home from the last playoff game."

If a tablet sounds like the perfect way to watch film comfortably, then great minds think alike. We want to build a Windows RT app to allow our coaches to watch their film from anywhere. 
Sounds like Hudl is pretty solid. What else could you possibly want?
Coaches want to have quick and easy access to their video. Sitting down with a tablet is one of the easiest and most convenient ways to do so. We want to allow coaches to use a Windows RT device to analyze film on the go, at practice, or during class while showing their students movies. We've seen tablet usage explode with our coaches and athletes - especially at the NFL and Division I levels. With the release of Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface, that growth will only speed up."

NUGener8 is currently being formed from collaborations between professors and students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln within the College of Architecture and College of Computer Science. Currently, the group is primarily grant-funded and is eager to innovate with its collaborative partnerships established in both fields. The long-term goal of the company is to explore computationally based solutions for architecture and the manifestation of the built environment. Throughout this process, its partners would like to form collaborations between colleges and students, sparking a larger culture of exploration and innovation within the university."
,"
NuGener8's design studio project is for the development of a small portion of a large set of tools for the design and construction of homes within the residential housing market. The overall mission of the project is to provide an interface that aligns the wants and needs of homeowners, architects and developers through an interactive, generative home-design tool."
,"
The design studio project proposes a web-based application that will allow developers to access plot information from a cloud-based geospatial database to determine placement of user-provided house models on a requested set of plots based on the house models' and plots' physical attributes.  The software will use user-provided addresses or plot files to query for/establish plot information and will generate a printable report of the floor plan inclusive of a two-dimensional visual, and will generate three-dimensional visualizations of suggested site placements."

This project will involve the development of an initial version of HomeGener8 Site.  The web application will provide integration of spatial plot data sets with home models that will allow them to be matched with an optimal plot using an algorithm and visualized as a three-dimensional building oriented on the plot. Parameterized plot and site information will be reported through a printable floor plan with a two-dimensional representation of the site."
,"
        Students are expected to evaluate each tool and/or technology based on its specific advantages and disadvantages as they relate to the HomeGener8 Site project. However, it is anticipated that students will find these tools and specifications to be most relevant to the project:"

Raikes alumni Nate Lowry and Brian Zimmer, along with Ben Rush, began exploring the potential for leveraging 3D depth cameras after Microsoft partnered with PrimeSense to commoditize what was once a very expensive technology.  In the summer of 2011, an opportunity was identified while collaborating with the Huskers to apply this technology to create the first holistic strength and conditioning system combining workout management, real-time feedback while lifting, automatic storage of lifting results, and video replay for form analysis."
,"
The EliteForm team was expanded with other Raikes alumni and Nebraska Global personnel.  EliteForm made its market debut six months later at the National Strength and Conditioning Association's annual Coaches Conference.  Through the course of the project, patents have been filed based on the core computer vision algorithms developed to process the depth images from the cameras.  EliteForm's platform involves more than just softwareâ€”custom hardware was designed to seamlessly embed technology as part of the athlete lifting experience at each lifting station.  Each PowerTracker unit is custom built by EliteForm and physical mountings are made by local manufacturing companies.
"
,"
The first step in implementing this strategy involved a group of interns during of the summer of 2012 to launch the StrengthPlanner solution as a SaaS offering.  Prospective customers can now sign-up for a 30 day trial and also purchase a subscription to the system.  The next step is for this Raikes student team to create the ability to digitally deliver strength cards to athletes and allow athletes to submit lifting results back to coaches.  This functionality has been requested by high schools that do not have the budget for PowerTracker units and by coaches who want to improve communication with remotely trained athletes. "
,"
The Raikes student team will work closely with the core EliteForm team as well as with prospective and current customers to determine the scope of work for this project.  Development will commence with building a mobile tablet application for Android or iOS to deliver strength cards to athletes.  We expect to release an initial version of this to beta customers by the end of first semester.  The project scope will continue to evolve based on customer feedback.  Known possibilities at this time include visually showing an athlete his development and expanding the delivery of strength cards to a web-based interface.  This could change based on customer feedback and ideas from members of this team.  "
,"
          Microsoft .NET framework and IDesign architecture patterns.  StrengthPlanner software is written in Microsoft .NET MVC and extensively utilizes JavaScript/JQuery.  PowerTracker units are powered by Windows Embedded and programmed with WPF and WCF.  The solution is powered by Windows Server 2008, Microsoft SQL 2012, and IIS 7.  Mobile/tablet products for Android and iOS are developed using MonoTouch and Mono for Android."

Locabal is a startup interested in improving the online marketplace experience. Currently, there are two options for artisans: pay a developer to create a website, which usually is low-quality and high-cost; or sell products through a site such as Etsy, where their products can easily get lost amidst hundreds of listings that are unorganized and often of poor quality. Locabal believes that the success of artisans and small businesses begins with success in their local community. We want to honor local artisans who produce quality products. By allowing them to easily create a profile, tell their story, and showcase their talents, Locabal gives them a voice. We plan to offer easy-to-use tools to help sell and market products.  The goal is not only to increase sales for artisans online, but to encourage people to visit sellers' brick-and-mortar stores as well as get to know the people behind the products they create."
,"
The goal of the Locabal Design Studio project is to create a fully-functional initial web service for buyers and sellers to help us enter the market, understand the needs of our customer base, and evolve our future product offerings. Because Locabal is in its infancy, there are a lot of unique opportunities with this project. Students will get to learn the steps towards building a brand-new product, positioning of software / product development to evolve the business, have stake in the company's success, and work in a fast-paced development environment. Locabal's goal is to stand up an initial online service that attracts both high-quality artisans and active buyers so that we can better understand our target market and customer base, as well as enhance our business model. This will be accomplished by a strong social integration, an intuitive recommendation engine, and support for artisans so that they as well as Locabal can be successful. By leveraging a buyer's social network, interests, friend's interest, and other data, we can recommend products that the buyer didn't even know they wanted until they saw them. Users can create wishlists and registries. A mobile application will allow users to rate and review businesses on the go when they visit, as well as receive discounts and pre-order items for pickup. From there, we can move the company to its next stage and help push the limits of what our customers can accomplish. "
,"
Because of the current stage of development in the project, the scope of the Design Studio project will likely change and adapt as we acquire a better sense of what customers need. Furthermore, DS students will have a large say in what features get implemented and at what point in the year. Second semester goals will be revised as needed to fit the needs of the company."
,"
This project will include many opportunities from both the technology side and the business side. Although we hope to assign students to tasks that will best fit their strengths and interests, we think that it is important that all team members have valuable input in all aspects of the company."
,"
  This project will require students who are adaptable to change and who can quickly turn around work. The web service will be written in .NET MVC. In the spring, development may include apps for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8.  Although our project is fairly large-scale, the project will develop along whatever path is most important for the development of the company.  A major part of this project will be positioning our software solution to achieve short-term growth of the company.  Business objectives will have a big influence on what the software will need to do, and members of the DS team will have a major stake in helping us form those objectives.  This project isn't just about software architecture, it is about business architecture and the role software can play in shaping it and our business."

,"The objective of this team is to create ServiceLinc, a constituent services tracking system, for the city of Lincoln, Nebraska. This tool is designed to aide in the tracking of and response to concerns of constituents throughout the city. These concerns include everything from potholes and nonfunctional streetlights to public nuisances to health and safety concerns."
,"The project's primary client contact is Lin Quenzer, Ombudsman for the city of Lincoln. It is the role of the Ombudsman to coordinate constituent concerns, refer problems to the proper agencies, and ensure that everything is completed in a timely matter. This is a challenging job, to say the least, and the team hopes that the ServiceLinc software it is developing with make this process more smooth.,
				      There are a number of important features of ServiceLinc which are projected to benefit the city and its members:"
,Constituent tracking
,"  With this system, the city will be able to conveniently maintain contact information for constituents who wish to leave their name.,
				       This will aid in concern follow-up, allowing the city to contact the citizen for more information or to let them know that their issue has been resolved. "
,Internal case tracking and prioritization
,"  Oftentimes, several city departments are solved in pursuing a citizen concern. This can lead to confusion regarding what has already been accomplished.,
				       ServiceLinc allows the city to prioritize concerns, helping to make sure that important matters are resolved as quickly as possible. "
,Long-term tracking
,"  Currently, there is no way for the Ombudsman to review the history of a particular case. Tracking down the details of exactly what happened becomes increasingly difficult as more and more departments become involved.,
				       ServiceLinc will also allow statistics such as average resolution time to be tracked. This can aid the Ombudsman in speeding up the process of addressing concerns and increasing the efficiency of the city government."
,Data integrity
,"  Constituent concerns often have many documents associated with them. Letters, emails, memos, and other correspondence accumulate and become difficult to manage.,
				       ServiceLinc will include a database to manage this information. Officials will be able to add everything from reports to digital photographs to the system, and ServiceLinc will keep of track what the data is and where it belongs. "
,The ServiceLinc team is making use of a number of powerful technologies in order to aid in the creation of this tool. These include:
,"  Visual Basic: The ""hard core"" programming of the project will be done in Visual Basic. This is what will allow the program to make sense of the data in its database.,
				       Active Server Pages: This technology accepts data and formats it into something that is convenient for the user to look at. All of the processing is done by a server, meaning that users will not have to use any special software in order to work with ServiceLinc. In fact, it will seem to them that the project is created entirely with HTML, the language of common web pages!,
				       JavaScript: JavaScript programming will help to ensure that users are inputting proper data. This will cut down on simple typos (such as forgetting the last digit of a telephone number), thus making the stored data that much more accurate."
,"Through close work with the Ombudsman and other city employees, the team is ensuring that their product will be used with great success upon completion. The advantages of such a system are enormous, and it is hoped that it will benefit both city employees and all of the residents of Lincoln."

,"Profile: Allied Strategy, LLC is a new venture organization that provides data transfer and interpretation to other organizations. Allied Strategy's Decision Support Network (DSN) is designed to facilitate the transfer of verification information, such as motor vehicle records and credit reports, from reporting agencies to clients who use this information in their business decision-making processes. Allied Strategy's initial target market lies in the property and casualty insurance industry."
,Problem/Opportunity: There is no standard format or technology by which organizations provide information. It is left to the organization requesting the information to interpret the data and put it in a useable form. This becomes a substantial burden for organizations that use multiple data sources because each report must be manually interpreted and entered into their information system.
,"Solution: As a new venture, Allied Strategy's entire information system is under construction. The J.D. Edwards Design Studio Team is developing a key component of this new system."
,For their portion of this project the J.D. Edwards team will:
," 1. Design the structure of the report ordering module,
				      2. Write services for use in a distributed computing environment,
				      3. Establish connectivity to a number of reporting agencies,
				      4. Convert proprietary and inconsistently formatted reports into an industry-standard format,
				      5. Translate reports from an industry-standard format into viewable documents"
,Technologies:
,"  Java, Jini, and Rio,
				       FreeBSD,
				       XML/XSL,
		          PostgreSQL"

Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, United States that develops, manufactures, licenses and supports a wide range of products and services related to computing. The company was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Microsoft is the world's largest software maker measured by revenues.  It is also one of the world's most valuable companies."
,"
Microsoft is market dominant in both the PC operating system and office suite markets (Microsoft Office). The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active in areas including internet search (with Bing), the video game industry (with the Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles), the digital services market (through MSN), and mobile phones (via the Windows Phone OS). In June 2012, Microsoft announced that it would be entering the PC vendor market for the first time, with the launch of the Microsoft Surface tablet computer. "
,"
Develop and expand on the Business Analyzer solution for the Windows 8 Phone and Microsoft Surface environments.  Many Microsoft customers, especially those who often travel, are interested in the ability to access more information at their fingertips. This project aims to satisfy these customers' needs by allowing them to quickly view business charts/reports on mobile phones and tablet devices. This Windows Phone 8/Windows RT application will allow businesses to deliver information to employees to make sound business decisions.  As a part of this project we also want to expand the Business Analyzer to work with the Xbox Kinect device.  This device would allow users to ""login"" to Business Analyzer and navigate through the app with gestures and spoken commands.  "
,"
The initial design of the Business Analyzer application has been done.  The UNL team will be responsible for adding additional functionality into the project that will be needed to allow the Windows Phone application to communicate with the Report Server location whether that would be in native mode or SharePoint integrated.  The Kinect functionality will be a new design as there is no current functionality incorporated into the application.  Within the scope there will be requirements that will need to be written, coding done to meet the requirements and then testing to make sure that the development meets the requirements.  "

  The Business Analyzer Application will use current functionality and technologies which includes but is not limited to:"

,"Profile: Allied Strategy offers enterprise-class solutions enabling the integration of verification information such as credit and motor vehicle reports into real-time decision systems. Allied's flagship ""Verification Server"" targets P&C Insurance, providing cost savings and competitive advantage through increased process efficiency and manageability, vendor independence, and industry standard XML formats."
,"Problem: P&C Insurance companies are required to interact with many external information providers through complex processes to obtain verification information for their insurance quotes. Many companies were not able to dedicate the technical resources required to complete this task, leaving companies unable to benefit from the cost savings and competitive advantages of integration."
,"Solution: The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team will be developing the initial version of the Verification Server solution, which will allow clients to integrate the ordering and processing of verification information reports into their existing quoting systems."

Assurity Life Insurance Company's origins are rooted in a century-long legacy of providing long-term security to policyholders, earning generations of customers' confidence and trust. "
,"
The Imaging Services Unit (ISU) of Assurity processes all paper and fax documents that come in to the company.  ISU scans the paper documents and tags the scans and faxes with information like policy number and name.

			"
,"
Currently, Assurity ISU uses an outdated, proprietary program from a third party provider that charges expensive license fees.  Assurity would like to replace this system with an in-house solution that is more up-to-date, more easily maintainable, and doesn't require license fees, but still has a familiar interface to minimize ISU employee retraining time.
			"
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team is working on a replacement for the current indexing program.  It is trying to minimize UI changes from the current program while still making improvements in other areas:"

			Allied Strategy is a start-up company formed by graduates of the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management (Britton Nielsen, Jeff Runyan, and Colby Thomson) in October, 2003.  The company provides innovative software solutions to the insurance industry.  This new initiative complements Allied Strategy's SEMCAT product, which assists insurance agents in providing accurate, comparative quotes for their customers.		
			"
,"
			Purchasing insurance is an important decision, but consumers currently have no objective means to determine the quality of an insurance company's service or to find a good agent to advise them.  Because insurance consumers suffer from an information disadvantage, they often make poor purchasing decisions. This insulates the insurance industry from the market effects necessary to ensure self-regulation. Government legislation has long attempted to address this issue, but social networking and online collaboration offer new opportunities to help consumers inform themselves.
			"
,"
			The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team will create an Amazon.com-like online portal enabling Americans to make informed insurance purchases. Users of the portal will be able to search for and buy from carriers and agencies rated highly based on personalized criteria. In addition, users will be able to share relevant stories and reviews to assist others in making good decisions. The site will make use of Web 2.0 technologies, a unique rating review and credibility system, and social networking collaboration tools to accomplish this goal.

,"Project Description: America First is an employee-owned international investment management organization. It is one of the largest investment banking firms in the Midwest. The real estate portion of the company consists of several smaller entities, three of which will utilize the Tenant Management System: America First Properties, America First Communities, and America First Apartment Investors, Inc. America First Properties alone oversees over 10,000 units in twenty states focusing on multifamily real estate. Modern advances in tenant management, especially those in military and student housing, creates a need for a more flexible system. The current technology in place at America First does not provide the extensibility and flexibility necessary to keep up with industry trends."

,Proposed System: The new Tenant Management System will effectively track tenants at all stages of the tenant lifecycle. The architecture for the system must be sufficiently flexible to adapt to new requirements and changing business processes. It must also be extendable for future integrations with other business systems.

Cerner is a leading supplier of Healthcare Information Technology Solutions that optimize clinical and financial outcomes."
,"
It is headquartered in Kansas City, with around 7800 associates located in offices around the world.  Its mission is to connect the appropriate persons, knowledge and resources at the appropriate time and location to achieve the optimal health outcome.
"
,"
Traditionally, nursing staff members have been assigned the task of manually monitoring and logging refrigerator temperatures multiple times each day, and alerting the appropriate personnel of any out-of-range events."
,"
Most hospitals have hundreds of refrigerators and freezers that contain temperature-sensitive items including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, blood and food. Malfunctions or human errors - such as a misadjusted thermostat or a leaving the door open - can cause temperatures to be too warm or too cold, compromising patient safety and increasing hospital expenses."
,"
The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and other regulatory agencies require that hospitals adhere to strict temperature monitoring standards. JCAHO has listed temperature monitoring among its top ten concerns."
,"
To date, few hospitals have implemented operational procedures to automate this process."
,"
The intent of this project is to create a Temperature Monitoring Unit Level View that will automate and optimize the process of tracking, alerting, and reporting refrigeration temperature information."
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will focus specifically on creating a solution that allows clinicians to view current and historical temperatures of a device in a heads up unit display, view visual alerts on the unit level view that indicate when a refrigerator's temperature is out of range, receive alert notifications when a temperature variance occurs, view temperature trends, and document variances and corrective actions taken.

Assurity Life Insurance Company has a legacy of providing Middle America with innovative protection-based financial solutions for every stage of life. Assurity products cover a vast domain of individual, family and business solutions. For the past 120 years, Assurity has demonstrated financial strength and stability while exhibiting an unrelenting commitment to long-lasting relationships with customers."
,"
Licensed in 49 states and the District of Columbia, Assurity products and services are available through a nationwide network of brokers who serve individual clients and to employees through their place of work. Assurity understands that consumers have unique protection needs as well as individual preferences for how they purchase their insurance protection; thus, the company strives to work for the best interest of its policyholders and earn customer confidence and trust."
,"
Assurity is searching for a secure and efficient way to send its distributors important notifications, including pending business requirements and state product approvals. Assurity's current system sends around 700 emails daily and has been described as overwhelming. It is looking for a cleaner, simpler and quicker way to push these notifications to its distributors. The quicker these action items can be completed, the quicker Assurity is able to complete the underwriting process and issue more policies. The Raikes School Design Studio team will assist Assurity in providing a communication app for mobile devices and tablets, alerting its users of new notifications in near real-time. "
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team is striving towards expediting Assurity's process of gaining new business by simplifying operations for distributors. The team will begin by focusing on securely sending two major types of notifications, New Business (pending business requirements) and State Product Approvals; however, the app will be designed with expansion capabilities for other types of notifications. The Raikes School Design Studio team will present Assurity with an application ready for distribution through the Android market that can be piloted by a handful of distributors. "

,Profile: The University of Nebraska Foundation is a not-for-profit organization independent of the University that collects private donations and distributes those funds across the different university campuses. The Foundation manages over $1 billion in assets and collects over $50 million in donations each year.
,"Problem/Opportunity: The current system that campuses use to request funds from the Foundation is effective but not efficient. It does not take advantage of improved technologies and, as a result, considerable time can elapse between the initial request for the funds and the final receipt. Additional time is required for adequately auditing the system."
,Solution: The J.D. Edwards Design Studio Team is creating a web-based system for the University campuses to request transfers and payments from their Foundation funds electronically. This will increase overall efficiency while reducing the volume of paper-based requests.
,The proposed online system will:
," 1. Provide an interface for University campuses to request funds electronically from the Foundation,
				      2. Provide automated fund availability information upon transfer request,
				      3. Provide internal Foundation auditors with a digital audit trail for each request.,
				      4. Integrate with the existing NU Foundation Online system and the Foundation's accounting information system."
,Technologies:
,"  J2EE 1.4,
				       Eclipse IDE 3.0.1,
				       Apache Tomcat 5.0.x,
		          IBM DB2 8.1"

,"Customer Profile: The USDA CAPS program ""is a combined effort by Federal and State agricultural organizations to conduct surveillance, detection, and monitoring of agricultural crop pests and biological control agents."" The significance of the program increased substantially with the new homeland security initiative, especially the part of the program that deals with hostile and dangerous pests and agents."
,"Business Situation: It took more than half a year for the plant and pest data to reach the central USDA database, delay which was not acceptable in the current security alert atmosphere. Moreover, the accuracy of the location data was not good enough. The USDA survey process consisted of field technicians going to the locations of interest and filling paper surveys about what they saw. Then, after the season was over they spent several weeks going through the paper surveys and putting them in electronic form (in a very complicated specific format required by the central database) and submitting them. Often the data was in the wrong format because of human error and was rejected. There were many different types of surveys and this data was spread across multiple databases."
,"Solution: The knowledge management system consists of a Pocket PC application on Windows CE for data collection and a Desktop Data Administration application to manage the collected data. To improve data accuracy, survey forms contained in the Pocket PC application are paired with location information from a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. Collected information is submitted in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) format to the Data Administration application. The Data Administration application parses the submitted data and stores it in a database designed by the team. From there the data can be selected for submission to the central USDA database. Other administrative functions include handling requests for surveys, assigning surveys to inspectors and handling diagnostic lab data."
,Business Benefits:
,"  Improved speed of data management. Application can save several months. Urgent information can be handled in a timely manner.,
				     Improved accuracy of the survey data through GPS units and single data entry.,
				     More accurate inspections. Administration can specify pests their inspectors need to look at.,
				     Usable survey forms. Forms on the Pocket PC contain extensive information about the pests."
,Technologies:
,"  Visual C#,
				     Windows CE,
				     Embedded Tools,
				     Access Database (to be ported to SQL if possible),
				     GPS Software,
				     iPaq"

,"Profile: The two primary sponsoring organizations of the BizFind project include the Nebraska Rural Initiative (UNRIP) and the Nebraska Business Development Center (NBDC). The mission of the Rural Initiative is to focus the knowledge, skills, and creativity on the four campuses of the University of Nebraska to stabilize and enhance the economy and quality of life in rural Nebraska. The NBDC offers planning and assessment assistance to get a new business started or to improve an existing business. NBDC consultants are MBAs, MBA candidates, and leaders from the Nebraska business community who focus on the particular needs of each client. Consulting is offered in the areas of new business start up, business growth, pollution prevention, government contracts, and technology management. In addition to consulting businesses, NBDC provides quality instruction and training in practical business applications.,
				  "
,"Problem: Neither the Nebraska Rural Initiative nor the Nebraska Business Development Center currently has an operational system in place to aid in the marketing of small businesses and communities in Nebraska. It is difficult to inform small businesses of the possibilities of selling their businesses, as there is no single medium through which to contact them. Many owners choose to close the business rather than sell it because they assume no potential buyers exist. Likewise, it has been difficult informing potential buyers of the opportunities of acquiring a small business. The NBDC has no way of reaching a large number of potential buyers and sellers without the proposed system. National websites do not focus heavily on small businesses in rural communities. Thus, the existing websites do not sufficiently solve the current problem. Realtors tend to be concentrated in large metropolitan areas and focus more on residential properties than on businesses.,

,"Solution: The goal of the BizFind project is to build a software system that helps link business buyers and sellers, which in turn supports the maintenance or growth of the economies of rural cities in Nebraska. To accomplish its goal, the BizFind project addresses the needs of a diverse group of users that include communities, existing business owners, potential buyers, families and entrepreneurs. The BizFind project will encourage the retention of existing businesses, promote generational transfer within families, assist with business transitions to qualified buyers, develop regional partnerships, identify and market community assets and opportunities, and educate about business growth, development and Profitability.,

,"Profile: The Nebraska Department of Property Assessment and Taxation (PA&T) collects, maintains, and distributes information in various formats to help administrators, tax payers, and beneficiaries of property taxes make informed decisions concerning the quality of the property tax assessment function in the State of Nebraska."
,"Problem/Opportunity: Continued growth in the State, along with additional requirements placed on assessors and PA&T, have created an extra burden on the processes at both the state and local levels of the system. Streamlining the assessment and taxation process with an integrated system has the potential to greatly reduce paperwork, increase accuracy, and support the process of valuing real property."
,"Solution: The Design Studio team, along with PA&T, is examining the current property assessment and transaction system in the state of Nebraska, focusing on the flow of information through the PA&T system and how redundancies can be avoided. This includes an assessment of how each county maintains and transmits its property information, as well as the ways that the information is used. A recommendation will be made to PA&T on how to modify its processes and information technology systems to create the most efficient property assessment environment. The J.D. Edwards Design Studio Team will evaluate and redesign the current assessment process, investigate possible information technology solutions, and provide a prototype system that represents the ï¿½look and feelï¿½ of the new system but does not provide specific functionality."

,"Benefits: The ultimate goal of this project is to provide PA&T with an improved ability to satisfy their primary customers - the citizens of the State, and the Nebraska legislators through:"
," 1. Improved data verification processes.,
				      2. Improved data availability and turnaround time on information requests.,
				      3. Increased accuracy of information maintained and reported.,
				      4. Reduced number of data entry points.,
				      5. A digital interface to the data available within PA&T.,
			      6. Decreased amount of time assessors must spend entering data into the system."

			Software Technology, Inc. (STI) develops, markets, sells, and supports software for the legal industry. STI has two widely used products: Tabs3 and PracticeMaster. The Tabs3 system tracks hours worked and creates bills based on those hours. PracticeMaster is used to manage legal practices. Its primary functions are scheduling and managing contacts. STI has been in business since 1979 and currently employs around 65 people.
			"
,"
			STI's internal order processing and invoicing systems were developed many years ago in what are now aging technologies. The legacy systems do not allow multiple users and cannot get updated data as often as STI would like. To improve the efficiency of its business processes, STI needs a new system developed with current technologies allowing multiple users and always current data. 
			"
,"
			The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team is developing a new Order Entry and Invoicing system in the latest version of Microsoft's .NET framework.  This system will provide all of the functionality in the existing system while adding a web interface and multi-user support. Over the course of the project, the J.D. Edwards Design Studio team will collaborate with STI's developers while using cutting edge technologies.

			The University of Nebraska - Lincoln (UNL) Design Studio Project is to be developed for the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Business Administration.  Both colleges are stakeholders in this project, as well as the College of Education and Human Sciences, the College of Engineering, and the departments of English, Computer Science, and Chemistry.  Graduate Studies at UNL is also a stakeholder.
			"
,"
			The Graduate Admissions Management System (GAMES) and the Graduate Student Information System (GSIS) are not presently designed to work together.  By creating a system that allows students to apply to graduate school and decision-makers to track applications, the process will be faster, easier, and more reliable.
			,
			The UNL Design Studio Project will work with multiple departments at UNL and the finished system will allow each department to have a customized design.
			"
,"
			The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team will be integrating and testing GAMES and GSIS to create a decision-based, online service that will simplify the application process.
			,
			Various customizable options will be developed for the general use of the systems over multiple colleges and departments at UNL.  The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team will gather requirements of the current graduate application process for each department and design the system to adapt to these different situations.

,"
The TeamMates Mentoring Program is a school-based one-to-one mentoring program. TeamMates began in 1991 with the vision of University of Nebraska head football coach Tom Osborne and his wife Nancy. Twenty-two football players met with middle school students in the Lincoln Public Schools."
,"
The program has continued to expand and currently, there are more than 4,000 mentor-mentee matches in 117 communities across Nebraska, western Iowa, and California. TeamMates strives to positively impact the world by inspiring youth to reach their full potential through mentoring and hopes to serve 10,000 youth by 2015.

"
,"
TeamMates currently uses a manual process of hardcopy applications to match mentees with mentors. Automating this process will help make the program more efficient by reducing the amount of time volunteers spend on creating quality matches."
,"
Ideally, the system will impact not only the quality of the matches, but also the longevity. To facilitate TeamMates' vision of serving 10,000 youth by 2015, the system will encourage potential mentors to apply and make an impact.

"
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will create an algorithm that matches mentors with mentees based off specified preferences and traits."

Through research, the Raikes School Design Studio team will determine which qualities are the most important in forming a mentor-mentee relationship. The system will display potential mentees to individuals who are exploring the possibility of becoming a mentor."
,"
After the application has been submitted, the system will save the preference information and suggest the best matches to TeamMates building coordinators.

,"About ITI: Information Technology, Inc. (ITI) has been one of the nation's leading financial technology providers for more than 25 years. Based in Lincoln, NE, ITI's 1000 employees provide a comprehensive suite of integrated software and services that are used by 3500 financial institutions ranging in size from de novos to banks with billions in assets. ITI is part of an extended family of companies, all subsidiaries of Fiserv, the leading provider of financial information management systems and services to an array of industries worldwide. Modern advances in tenant management, especially those in military and student housing, creates a need for a more flexible system. The current technology in place at America First does not provide the extensibility and flexibility necessary to keep up with industry trends."
,"Current System: ITI's current Accounts Payable System (APS) provides comprehensive, parameter-driven control of vendors, purchase orders, payables, and checks. APS complements the ITI Premier System and the ITI Financial Management System. It is a legacy mainframe-based COBOL system that uses a proprietary database structure, a terminal emulation user interface, and a batch process to bring individual vendors up to date. The current product is in use internally at ITI and is also licensed by some of their clients."
,"Proposed System: The new APS should function as a real-time process with a goal of automating the current workflow and adding additional functionality. It will be designed and constructed using modern technology and modeling methods. This new technology includes, but is not limited to, the use of a relational database structure with a browser-based user interface. This system will be implemented internally, with the potential of being licensed by some of ITI's clients. "

Werner Enterprises, Inc. was founded in 1956 and is a premier transportation and logistics company, with coverage throughout North America, Asia, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia. Werner maintains its global headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska and maintains offices in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China and Australia."
,"
Werner is among the five largest truckload carriers in the United States, with a diversified portfolio of transportation services that includes dedicated, medium-to-long-haul, regional and local van capacity, expedited, temperature-controlled and flatbed services.
"
,"
Today, customer service managers must run several different inquiries periodically during the day to see what exceptions may be happening to their customer's shipments."
,"
This manual process can result in inconsistent data.  This manual process can also delay communication until late in the life cycle of a shipment."
,"
The lack of notification of missing critical information often creates more work and incorrect billing.
"
,"
The project will entail developing a highly expandable event publishing system that other Werner systems can connect to.  In addition, the solution will include a message service that will enable Werner's Supply-chain Management System to notify internal and external stakeholders of events and conditions that occur as a part of the daily management of a customer's supply chain."

The solution addresses a need for integration between Microsoft Dynamics AX and other software for the purpose of budgeting.  Currently, many users are forced to create budgets outside of Dynamics AX and then manually integrate their budget with the rest of their business solution.
			"
,"
The proposed solution will utilize non-shipping Microsoft development technologies to integrate Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Dynamics AX.  The solution will allow for the export of budgets from Dynamics AX to Excel as well as the import of Excel budgets into the Dynamics AX system.

		Microsoft Dynamics is a line of commercial business-management solutions that integrates with other Microsoft software.   Dynamics GP integrates financial management, supply chain management, and customer relationship management into an adaptable Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software system.
			"
,"
Microsoft Dynamics GP currently does not offer any real-time communication options among vendors, customers, and employees.  Microsoft would like the Raikes School Design Studio team to enhance the unified communication functionality by add real-time knowledge of users' online statuses, instant messaging, and phone system integration to Microsoft Dynamics GP.
			"
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team plans to integrate Office Communicator with Dynamics GP to offer real-time knowledge of users' online statuses, provide instant messaging between the customer and the supplier, and display caller ID information when a customer calls.  These unified communication features will simplify interactions among Dynamics GP users.

		Mutual of Omaha offers a wide range of financial products and services to its customers. The Direct to Consumer (DTC) Organization at Mutual of Omaha is responsible for Direct Marketing to prospective customers by various marketing channels, such as Direct Mail, Telemarketing, and the Web. Mutual of Omaha markets products directly and through third parties such as clubs and organizations, financial institutions, and non-financial institutions."
,"
There are approximately 300 DTC campaigns planned and held each year, which range from several thousand solicitations to over 30 million solicitations in a single campaign.  
			"
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will be redesigning and updating a DTC Budget Tool to assist the client in developing budgets for several types of marketing campaigns used by the company. The existing DTC Budget Tool is outdated and difficult for marketers to use. The new system will be a secure, role-based web application that can be used on the company's internal network. Additionally, the system will be compatible with the client's current database and internal software restrictions.
			"
,"
By redesigning the current DTC Budget Tool, Mutual of Omaha will see a savings in the time employees spend on the system. In addition, the system will eliminate the need for manual updates to budget data. Mutual of Omaha will also see improvements in their overall campaign budgeting processes through the additional features added by the Raikes School Design Studio team.

Interact is actively selling our VIP product to consumers around the world.  Many of our prospective customers have requested a graphical tool to be used for the development of the VoiceXML/CCXML applications.  Interact has offered our contract services to these potential customers to build their custom VoiceXML/CCXML applications, but many of these customers wish to manage these applications from within their organizations.

The envisioned solution is one where application designers logon to a web based application to access the development environment.  Once logged in users have the ability to create, view, and update projects.  Application designers will modify the projects by dragging and dropping logical blocks onto a grid to construct the desired logical application flows.

,"Profile: The Nebraska Animal Verification Enhancement (NAVE) project is a collaborative effort of the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management Software Design Studio and the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. The NAVE team has developed software that will allow the state's livestock producers to automatically track animal locations throughout the life cycle, enabling animal health officials to trace the location of any animal in the event of a foreign animal disease outbreak. This ""traceback"" is expected to take less than 48 hours, instead of weeks, helping to mitigate a potential catastrophe."
,Solution: Team members have worked closely with state and federal officials to implement Nebraska's portion of the US Animal Identification Program (USAIP); the NAVE team is building for Nebraska the first all-new USAIP-compliant system in the country. This system will give the nation's food supply and Nebraska's beef industry an additional measure of safety and security.

Proxibid, headquartered in Omaha, brings auctioneers and bidders together for a world-class online auction experience. Since 2002, the company has worked with more than 2,500 auctioneers to bring more than 35,000 auctions to a global, online audience. With registered bidders from more than 190 countries, no other provider in the industry connects more buyers and sellers than Proxibid. Proxibid's proprietary live Internet bidding service and Web site were developed by auctioneers and industry-leading professionals to provide our bidders with the most user-friendly and comprehensive online auction experience possible. "
,"Proxibid's marketplace continues to grow at a rapid pace, with new inventory being added every day. Hundreds of thousands of bidders will participate in nearly 10,000 auctions on Proxibid this year, placing more than five million bids on more than 2.5 million lots. Everything from fine art, antiques and collectibles to industrial machinery, heavy equipment and farm machinery and real estate will pass through Proxibid's marketplace this year. 
"
,"
Proxibid's presence is currently limited to a traditional website with functionality such as browsing and searching auction content, managing accounts, and live or timed bidding. With mobile technology becoming ubiquitous and a desire to attract younger customers, Proxibid needs the ability to provide features of its website to customers using mobile phones and tablets. "
,"
To meet Proxibid's goals of entering the mobile marketplace and attracting new users, the Raikes Design Studio team will create a native Android 
application that provides access to online auctions and supporting activities. In addition to extending the traditional website experience, this application will incorporate phone specific features. This mobile application will be 
reliable, secure, and provide a positive and engaging user experience.

Nelnet, Inc. is a company based out of Lincoln, Nebraska that provides quality student loan products and services to students, as well as a full range of student-lending services and technology-based products to schools nationwide. This includes student loan origination and lending, holding, student loan and guarantee servicing and software solutions.

Total Well-Being (TWB) is a subsidiary of Nelnet that specializes in consulting services in employee wellness. The application purchased by TWB is used by Nelnet and companies outside of Nelnet, but the system is not meeting the program needs of the company. The current system is supposed to encourage users to lead an active, healthy lifestyle by participating in challenges and wellness coaching offered through TWB. The process employed by the current system is confusing and counterproductive to the goals of TWB. Therefore, Total Well-Being's attempt to engage employees has not been as successful and the need for a new system is essential in order to keep employees healthy and the cost of health care down. "
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will create a new, user-friendly wellness system for Nelnet. The clients of Total Well-Being will be able to tailor the system to their individual needs and the needs of their employees by creating challenges unique to their company. The customized challenges allow employers to create incentives for employees who exhibit healthy behavior. Employees will also be able to easily track their nutrition and exercise. By streamlining the application and giving employees the opportunity to take control of their own wellness, they will experience enhanced daily interaction with the wellness system, employers and each other.

Fiserv is the leading global provider of information management and e-commerce for the financial services industry. It was founded in 1984 in Brookefield, Wisconsin, and specializes in transaction processing, outsourcing, electronic bill payment and presentation, investment management solutions, and more. This year marks the seventh year of the Raikes School and Fiserv partnership in designing and developing software for internal and external consumption. "
,"
Today, small businesses have methods of online banking, but there is not a mobile solution available to fully meet the financial needs of small businesses. The ability to receive a financial event notification and react accordingly while away from the office would be a valuable asset to any small business and the business's financial institution. The Raikes School Design Studio team has the opportunity to develop a solution for this untapped portion of the financial services market. "
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will develop an Android application for Fiserv that will deliver real-time financial event notifications to small business personnel and allow users to take appropriate action for these events. Special consideration will be taken regarding the design of the back end of the system so that the solution can be extended to other platforms in the future. "

Nebraska Global was founded on the belief that Nebraska communities have the components necessary to become a vibrant and influential technology leader in the U.S., but currently that untapped potential is manifested in weak or misguided efforts. In 2009, under the leadership of knowledgeable and motivated software veterans, Nebraska Global recognized the growth potential and strong foundation in the community and developed a vision to reform Nebraska into a forerunner in business and technology."
,"
Don't Panic Labs was the first investment by Nebraska Global and was formed to create the necessary environment and culture to establish a software factory capable of turning out world-class products and technology. 
"
,"
Beehive, one of the companies being launched by Nebraska Global and Don't Panic Labs, is a platform for asset management to be used by a variety of different organizations and industries. A major differentiator for this platform will be the ability for users to access and interact with the system from mobile platforms in both a connected and disconnected environment. However, this mobile platform support has not yet been created. In addition, Don't Panic Labs would like a cross-platform framework that will allow efficient, creative and streamlined mobile development in the future. "
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team aims to develop a set of APIs and working UIs for multiple mobile platforms that allow a native application to sync data to and from a cloud-based database, manage a connected and disconnected environment, wrap the native APIs for GPS, camera, accelerometer, gyro, etc., and manage local data storage in a secure manner. The goal is to have a consistent set of capabilities across the following devices: Windows 8 tablet, iPhone and iPad, Android tablet and phone, and Windows Phone 7. Beehive will serve as the SDK test application. "

Founded in 1975, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses reach their full potential. The company is responsible for industry-leading software such as Windows, Microsoft Office and the .NET framework. Microsoft is also an innovator in enterprise resource planning (ERP) services through its Microsoft Dynamics product line. Officially unveiled in February 2010, Windows Phone is one of the newest initiatives in the Entertainment and Devices Division. "
,"
In one of its latest endeavors, Microsoft is striving to unify the experiences across mobile devices, personal computers (PCs) and television. Today, a majority of employees have smartphones and often want the same information available to them across these three platforms. These employees, especially those who often travel, are interested in the ability to access more information at their convenience. "
,"
Currently, employees are unable to access company-specific financial information on their mobile devices. If businesses could deliver snippets of relevant financial information to mobile devices, employees would experience improved performance and higher efficiency. 
"
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will tackle this opportunity using a combination of raw ingenuity and cutting-edge technologies. The completed product will predictably deliver relevant financial information to mobile devices in a way that provides a seamless Windows Phone experience so that customers have the ability to make well-informed business decisions and react to changes on-the-fly. "
,"
The solution will leverage revolutionary technology such as LiveTile and cloud-based services to deliver financial data in easy-to-interpret charts and simplified ledger formats. These reports and charts will reside in an easily-accessible report library. At the conclusion of our project, the solution will be published on the app marketplace. "

,"Project Background: Sandhills Publishing offers technical support to all its computer publication subscribers. This technical support lies mostly in searching articles from all previous Sandhills Publishing computer publications and information in a specific technical support area. Currently, a subscriber has the option of searching the Smart ComputingÂ© website or calling Sandhills Publishing for answers to any question regarding his or her computer. Sandhills Publishing representatives utilize the same process to find answers. This process lacks a centralized mechanism for storing, indexing, and retrieving information. This can result in inefficient searches and in some instances information may be missed in the search process."
,"*Proposed System:The key to providing quick, to-the-point answers with a minimal amount of effort is to provide an advanced diagnostic and search tool. A user or representative will type in a question or use a diagnostic tool to search through a list of categories to find solutions. The tool will search through Sandhills Publishing's solution database and previous articles. As new solutions are identified, they will be added to the database. Recent lists of frequently asked questions will be logged and displayed to the users."
,*Proposed Benefits The benefits of this project to Sandhills Publishing include
," * Potential increases to both subscriber base and revenue, by providing quick, detailed answers to questions, and,
				      * Increased competitiveness with technical support organizations at both the local and national level."
,*Technologies:
," * Microsoft SQL Server Database,
				      * VB.NET,
				      * ASP.NET"

The UNL College of Journalism and Mass Communications is one of the top journalism colleges in the country. In the summer of 2011 the college placed second nationally in the Hearst Journalism Awards, which are commonly called the student Pulitzers. It is a member of the Carnegie-Knight Consortium, which are considered the 11 best colleges of journalism in the U.S."
,"
The college is rapidly changing its curriculum to include new courses to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving media industry. It is emphasizing the use of mobile communication and mobile devices in its instruction. The college is adding classes in new product development and app creation, but does not currently have students with the computer programming background or abilities these classes require. Consequently, it is team-teaching with computer science and working with the Raikes School.

Journalism typically ends upon publication, inspiring little user action. With this project, journalism looks to be a means to an endâ€” engaging people to interact and act upon the stories and pictures they view. "
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will develop a web application geared toward the iPad and other tablet devices that enables journalism students to showcase multimedia stories and prompt users to take action. Showcasing student work in such a manner will improve the already high perception of the UNL College of Journalism and Mass Communications. Users will be able to share and act upon content, generating community discussion and interaction. "

,Project Description: The State of Nebraska Department of Administrative Services is responsible for reconciling many transactions with a number of banks across the state. This reconciliation currently takes too long to perform using the manual processes in place. Receipts and bank statements come into the State in various formats and in large quantities. Hundreds of hours per month are spent on tasks that could be automated.
,"*Project solution:The State of Nebraska Design Studio Team will create a system to automate the reconciliation process. The State of Nebraska will use this system on a daily basis to complete the reconciliation quickly. This will allow their employees to spend their time on other important activities. At the completion of our project, the State's new reconciliation system will allow for improved timeliness of the reconciliation process and provide better auditing of their enterprise systems and the major banks.

,"
Persons age 65 and older constitute a growing segment of the U.S. population and require increased medical attention and supervision. Unfortunately, our aging population cannot necessarily rely on their loved ones to care for them on a daily basis or afford increasingly expensive healthcare, assisted living programs and nursing homes. Instead they take pride in retaining independence and leading a life of their own. "
,"
Cerner hopes to address these issues and build a foundation for a comprehensive home-based solution suite by creating a ""plug-and-play"" system in which location devices can be strategically placed throughout the home and on the individual to monitor their movement within the house. If activity decreases or critical activities are not observed (such as going to the bathroom where their pills are presumably stored), an alert should be sent to emergency contacts. Intuitive user interfaces are also required to enable easy setup and allow caretakers to periodically observe activity metrics. In addition to providing a higher level of security, this solution will foster an environment of independence and decrease the fears associated with ""what-if"" situations that could occur when no one is around. "
,"This project is Cerner's first foray into the home monitoring industry and will be architected in such a way to facilitate future enhancements (i.e. monitoring vital signs, medicine intake, etc.) and cloud deployment. "

	""Millennials,"" those born between 1982 and 2000, approach social communication and interaction differently than previous generations. Today, Millennials have extended communication beyond phone calls and emails to text messaging and online social networking. Their expectations have already begun to drive changes in many industries, including the financial industry. As wealth transfers from the Baby Boomers to the Millennials, and as the Millennials and following generations enter the workforce, the financial industry must employ concepts like online social networking, mobile transactions and SMS communication.  
			"
,"
The purpose of the Raikes School Design Studio team is to provide ITI with ideas and prototypes about the future of banking. ITI will leverage the youth and talent of the student team to develop a new banking solution that is more mobile, interactive, and ubiquitous. The completed solution will provide ITI with a head start on the Millennial Banking revolution.

,"Project Background: Lincoln Electric System (LES) is a public utility providing electricity to approximately 121,494 retail customers (meters) and has Total Operating Revenues of $168,487,700 as of December 31, 2004. LES currently uses a financial modeling system to aid in decision and rate making and to display the financial condition of LES to the rating agencies."

,The current financial modeling software was developed over 25 years ago. System stability of the existing technology is a risk to LES as is potential incompatibility with new operating systems. Upgrading the system to add new financial tests and indicators for use by management and outside analysts provides additional limitations. The new system will provide the ability to electronically exchange inputs and outputs and the ability to perform analysis on alternative financial scenarios.
,Project Goals: The goals of the corporate financial model are to provide the ability to
,"  analyze corporate historical and future financial conditions,,
				     quickly produce and track results of various financial services,,
				     produce the information and reports required by financial rating agencies,,
				     have system portability, so that it will operate with or without network connectivity, and,
				     complete sensitivity analysis on key variables. "

,"Project Background: Currently, PayPal has several different call routing scenarios in place at their Global Operations Center. Calls are routed on the basis of agent availability as well as call type. When there is a relatively low call volume, PayPal has no problem answering all calls within the required amount of time. But, when the queues begin back up, PayPal must simply try one of the other call routing scenarios and see if the queues improve. PayPal has no way to determine the outcome of changing to a new scenario. This is the problem PayPal Design Studio team will solve."

,Project Goals:The primary goal of the PayPal simulation system will be to test the most efficient ways to manage the front end processes of the PayPal Global Operations Center through a series of ï¿½What ifï¿½ scenarios.
,"Proposed system:The system will be a simulation that models the current processes of the front end of the PayPal Global Operations Center. The PayPal Simulation system will assist in the decision making process to help PayPal optimize call routing, in the attempt to achieve optimal utilization of PayPal resources. The simulation will allow users to enter variables such as agent information, agent type, current call volume, and current types of calls, which will facilitate a user in determining the best routing of calls, and allowing the user to modify in real time how the calls are being routed."
,Scope: This project will allow:
,"  Simulation of PayPal's Global Operation Center,
				     Rule's based routing configuration,
				     Analysis of changes to real-time routing rules,
				     Animated scenarios for visual impact of changes,
			        Additions/changes to applicable model parameters"

,"Project profile: Mutual of Omaha is a financial services company that offers protection from the unforeseen and help for achieving financial goals. Mutual's Information Services operation partners with internal business units to enable critical processes by delivering quality, cost-effective technology solutions that meet business needs. In addition to a meaningful summer internship program that three current J.D. Edwards students participated in, this is the fourth consecutive year Information Services has partnered with the J.D. Edwards Design Studio to develop a technological solution that will improve the efficiency of business operations."
,"Project Opportunity:The Retirement Plans Division currently utilizes an Excel based pricing system to facilitate the IRAdvantage Wealth Builder quoting and pricing process. This system allows the user to input several data items. From these data items, several calculations are performed, and a proposal document is produced. This system can be improved by increasing the levels of flexibility, usability, and efficiency to provide accurate quotes in a timely manner."
,"Project Solution: The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team is working with Mutual of Omaha to redesign the IRAdvantage Wealth Builder pricing system. The new system will create a streamlined data input process, provide the ability to store and rerun pricing scenarios, and automate the data clean-up process, all of which will help to make Mutual of Omaha's Retirement Plans Division's pricing more competitive."
,Project Benefits: The pricing system will increase efficiency through less manual data entry and manipulation and an improved user interface. This new IRAdvantage Wealth Builder pricing system will also allow Mutual of Omaha customers to quickly and easily compare available retail options.

Vestn was formed in March of 2011 by Conner Dana and Brian Cary with the mission of fundamentally changing the way that young job seekers express their talents and abilities to potential employers, in addition to providing smaller companies with a new and unique service for connecting with young talent. Conner is currently pursuing Management and Marketing majors at UNL, and Brian is a senior Computer Engineering major in the Raikes School of  Computer Science and Management. Recently the company has added Phil Baylog, an Actuarial Science major also enrolled in the Raikes School, as a partner and partial owner. The three bring strong backgrounds in technology and business to the company, along with a passion for entrepreneurship. "
,"
The opportunity for the Raikes School Design Studio team lies in the creation of the HR platform designed by Vestn. The team will see an idea go from design to finished product, and launch it live to the public. Vestn's Design Studio project is a real startup company environment; the team members will be interacting with clients, eliciting feedback, and making changes to a live system. "
,"
The scope of this project is contained within three product Releases. The job-seekers, who we refer to as ""Users"", have the ability to create a profile on the site and prove their skills by uploading their top four projects. Projects can be anything from schoolwork to personal endeavors, giving Users the opportunity to show off their style and quality of work. Release 1 includes the full development of the User profile. The profile should be programmed in a way that code can be extracted out into separate objects and reused for Release 2, which is the full development of the Business Profile. The Business Profile will allow Businesses to upload content viewable by all Users. This content includes pictures of the office, descriptions of office culture, information about what the company is working on, and any additional data companies would like seen by potential employees. Release 3 focuses on connecting the Business and the Profiles while adding a Home Page for each. "

Many companies will look to internal data to identify business trends and performance as well as industry data to identify how well the business is competing with their industry."
,"
For this project, the Raikes School Design Studio team will use several Microsoft technologies to create a web-based application that will enable users to analyze data trends."
,"
This application will also aide business decision makers to analyze current and historical data, perform what-if analysis, identify patterns in consumer behavior, and make comparisons against other companies in their industry."
,"
In order to meet Microsoft Dynamics' goal of increasing usability of its current Business Intelligence product, the Raikes School Design Studio team will create a what-if analysis application for Microsoft Dynamics GP that will enable users to perform analysis on consumer and industry trend data in a web-based environment."
,"
The project will be considered a success if a user can take a report in excel, click a button, and have the data analysis displayed in an organized user form. Users will be able to make projections based on their current data and also analyze how changing one variable will affect other variables using the user form.

			Pen-Link, Ltd. is a Lincoln, NE based company that supplies law enforcement with technology to assist in intelligence gathering and surveillance.  Starting in 1986 with software called Pen-Link for pen register data, Pen-Link, Ltd. has since evolved its software and hardware solutions to include analysis and collection of many forms of communication including voice, data, and IP traffic.
			"
,"
			The current Pen-Link application suite consists of a two-tier rich desktop application.  With this model, field investigators must return to headquarters and sync their computers to get the latest data.  This lack of remote synchronization requires time and effort while costing the field investigators their mobility.  Due to these inconveniences, part of the customer base is using other means of synchronization.  Furthermore, one of Pen-Link's largest customers has expressed a need for a remote synchronization feature. 
			"
,"
			The vision of the Pen-Link Design Studio Project is to provide a robust and extensible multi-tier web application framework to allow rapid development of functional modules and achieve a high degree of flexibility.  Along with this framework, the J.D. Edwards Design Studio team will design, develop and implement a web client that will offer core functions of the current Pen-Link application suite via wireless technologies.  This solution will provide field investigators with more agility by providing easy real-time data synchronization.

IBM is working to expand this type of work in support of an initiative called ""Social Everywhere."" Their goal is to create the ability to easily expose social software attributes within a variation of applications users work in all the time. IBM is looking to utilize advancements in creating these types of software solutions that can easily be re-purposed in a variety of ways."
,"
The project vision is to enable IBM LotusÂ® Connections to be consumed by other enterprise applications, giving these applications access to the LotusÂ® social network. This utilization of LotusÂ® Connections will be accomplished through the creation of gadgets. These gadgets will allow users to correlate social information in a way that delivers more meaningful intelligence versus just another series of numerical reports that are devoid of any real context."
,"
In order to accomplish this goal, the Raikes School Design Studio team seeks to simulate a web application that will act as the service to consume a Connections gadget. By doing so, the gadget functionality will be exposed to the web application creating a larger impact on existing enterprise applications outside of Connections. In this way, Connections works alongside familiar applications, extending the functionality and efficiency of the network as a whole.

			Microsoft Dynamics is a line of integrated and adaptable solutions for business process automation and is the feature product line of Microsoft Business Solutions. The Microsoft Dynamics line encompasses multiple solutions targeted at different markets, segmented by size and global location; Microsoft Dynamics GP is the most widely used mid-market business process management solution in the United States and Canada. 
			"
,"
			The goal for this project is to leverage the Windows Workflow Foundation (WinWF) to create a seamless and efficient way to manage new vendors in Microsoft Dynamics GP. Currently, when a company adds a new vendor to its Dynamics GP system, various users must approve the new vendor, route the vendor card among themselves, and enter all required vendor information before manually setting the vendor to 'active.' The vendor can then be used within the system. 
			"
,"
			This project will create a Vendor Approval Workflow system to integrate this process into Dynamics GP and create an efficient workflow. Dynamics GP currently contains many workflow solutions that leverage WinWF. This project will extend these technologies to streamline vendor approval. 
			,
			The Vendor Approval Workflow system will be built around WinWF provided in the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS). There will be a similar user experience across the Dynamics GP, Microsoft Outlook, and MOSS applications. Therefore, users will not have to spend time learning multiple interfaces. The system will also be flexible and provide users with multiple configurations regarding permissions, responsibilities, and approval criteria.

			The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team aims to integrate expense report management into the Microsoft Dynamics GP solution. This will reduce dependence on paper receipts and speed processing by incorporating data directly into other modules. By implementing expense reporting within the current frameworks, expense reporting will be simplified, resulting in consistently accurate information across the end-consumers' organizations.

			For 30 years, Information Technology, Inc. (ITI), a subsidiary of Fiserv, Inc., has been one of the nation's leading financial technology providers.  The comprehensive solutions it offers combine openly integrated software with advanced support services, and are used by more U.S. banks and savings institutions than those from other vendors.  The company is headquartered in Lincoln, NE. 
			"
,"
			ITI offers a wide variety of comprehensive, flexible, and informative training classes to their clients.  Currently, clients coordinate and manage employee class participation manually via telephone or e-mail.  An integrated system that automates, streamlines, and tracks employee training initiatives will enhance ITI client's ability to provide knowledge to increase employee efficiency and maximize technology investment.
			"

			The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team will be developing ITI's Premier Education Management System.   This system will be able to deliver customizable training packages to employees, and track their training progress.  Additionally, managers will be able to monitor their subordinate employees' training progress.  The system should benefit ITI by increasing customer satisfaction and reducing the number of customer support calls taken.

			International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation has nearly 100 years of doing business in the field of information handling. Nearly all the company's products were designed and developed to record, process, communicate, store, and retrieve information -- from its first scales, tabulators, and clocks to today's powerful computers and vast global networks.
			"
,"
			As a leader in the information technology world, IBM must strive to provide the newest tools and applications to its customers. One area that IBM is looking to extend is its electronic service offerings. Instead of waiting for customers to discover problems on their machines, IBM would like a proactive service solution that identifies potential problems based on information gathered from customer environments. 
			"
,"
			The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team is developing a prototype of a proactive service model. This model will serve to prove the viability of such a solution within the realm of IBM's business processes. The proactive service model will use information gathered by IBM scanners to diagnose potential problems on customer machines before they are encountered by the customer.

			Assurity Life Insurance Company traces its roots back more than 100 years to the formation of three long-time Lincoln-based insurers: Woodmen Accident and Life, Security Financial Life and Lincoln Direct Life. Through a series of consolidations, these three Lincoln-based insurers were merged into what today is Assurity Life. Assurity Life serves customers in 49 states, offering disability income, critical illness, hospital indemnity, long-term care and life insurance, annuities and specialty insurance plans through its individual and worksite distributors and direct mail. Pension and investment management services are available through a subsidiary of Assurity Life. With assets exceeding $2 billion, Assurity Life has built a reputation for best in class service and sound, conservative business practices with a disciplined approach to financial management.
			"
,"
			Assurity Life's individual product line is marketed through a distribution system which utilizes brokers or agents. One of the ways Assurity Life and its distributors promote the individual product line is through public Web sites. These sites currently contain product specifics but do not provide the agents and prospective clients with the ability to run a premium quote. Assurity Life offers a complete line of products with simplified underwriting, and has chosen the following products to have online premium quotes:,
			Â Â Â Â  Simplified Critical Illness Insurance,
			Â Â Â Â  Simplified Life Insurance,
			Â Â Â Â  Acci-Flex Life Insurance,
			Â Â Â Â  Simplified Disability Income Insurance,
			"
,"
			The purpose of the Assurity Life J.D. Edwards Design Studio team is to design, build and implement four Web calculators for agent and potential customer use. The calculators will allow these users to directly input their information on the Web and immediately receive a quote. The proposed solution will allow Assurity Life to more strongly promote its simplified product portfolio, resulting in increased sales and recruitment of new producers.

			As the largest family-owned aircraft support facility in North America, Lincoln-based Duncan Aviation believes in investing in their facilities and people and in developing innovative products, services and processes. Duncan Aviation services all major business aircraft and works to attain the highest customer satisfaction possible in any service industry, not just in the world of corporate aviation.
			"
,"
			Duncan Aviation's application environment includes myDuncan.aero, a Web-based Java application for use by both internal and external customers and AS4W, an internally developed Java client application (J2SE). The current document and image retrieval is a manual process. It involves physical paper documents stored in file cabinets and electronic documents stored on network or local drives. The organization of those systems is based on user defined parameters and does not provide all users access to important documents and images. 
			"
,"
			The goal for the J.D. Edwards Design Studio team is to design a framework that allows users to tag, associate, and retrieve media (images, electronic documents, videos, etc.) on the IBM Content Manager from the AS4W application and the myDuncan.aero Web site. Ultimately this will allow Duncan Aviation employees to be more efficient in their storage and queries of document media.

Microsoft is an internationally recognized software development firm. It is responsible for industry leading software such as Windows, Microsoft Office, and the .NET framework. Microsoft continues to be an innovator in enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) services through its Microsoft Dynamics line of products. "

The Microsoft Dynamics line does not currently have a centralized human resources application for time and attendance functionality. Microsoft would like the Raikes School Design Studio team to create a web based, self-service application that improves the user experience by streamlining the business processes."
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team plans to use various Microsoft technologies to create a standalone application for time entry and attendance that makes the business process more efficient, can be adapted to meet the needs of a variety of businesses, and has an easy to use and appealing interface for employees and managers.  The Raikes School Design Studio team's solution will be able to be integrated with other Microsoft products and will serve as a model for similar web based applications across the entire product line."

International Business Machines (IBM) CorporationÂ® is a global provider of enterprise computer hardware, and software and business consulting services and software.  IBM has been known through most of its recent history as the world's largest computer company; with over 400,000 employees worldwide, IBM is the largest information technology employer in the world.  IBM LotusÂ® Connections is social software for business that empowers you with the collective knowledge of your organization, your partners and your customers by dynamically building new connections between people you may not know, the expertise they have and the tasks they are executing.  Lotus Connections provides a suite of services (Profiles, Activities, Blogs, Communities, Wikis, Files and Bookmarks) that can be used individually or together. "
,"
People and teams want to be more productive and to interact more effectively. Businesses need to respond to customer issues, market developments, and new business opportunities faster than ever before.  When people can discover information, tap knowledge networks, and share ideas, innovation blooms and business practices flourish.  IBM social software helps discover experts, expand personal networks, and makes it a snap to share -- so teams can function better and ""out maneuver"" their competition.  As a result there is an expanding need to make this information available anytime, anywhere -- desktop or mobile. "
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will work to extend the mobile functionality currently available to Lotus Connections customers.  This will require making enhancements to the currently supported services as well as the creation of additional services.  The solution will be a micro-browser implementation targeted for the iPhone and Nokia S60 devices. "

Mutual of Omaha offers a wide range of financial products and services to its customers. It was founded in 1909 as Mutual Benefit Health and Accident Association. In 1941, Mutual formed a Group Insurance department. Today, Group Insurance has two main customer facing web applications, Group Web Reporting and Billing and Account Maintenance. There are over 11,000 registered external users for Group Web Reporting and Billing and Account Maintenance. In 2008 approximately 500,000 transactions were entered by external users and processed through the Billing and Account Maintenance application."
,"
Group Web Reporting and Billing and Account Maintenance are using older technologies that do not conform to Mutual's long-term architectural recommendations. These six-year-old applications are sufficient for the time being but will need to be updated for the future."
,"Currently, users who represent multiple groups are required to sign on individually for each group. The project aims to enhance login functionality to allow single sign-on for these users."

,"
The Innovation Accelerator (IA) is a public-private partnership with the federal government whose mission is to promote our nation's competitiveness in the global economy by promoting America's innovation. Based in New York City and Omaha, IA serves emerging companies that have received significant grant funding from the government by helping them to succeed. IA works with emerging technology innovators and established technology companies across the United States. IA's mentors and corporate partners include Fortune 500 companies in various industry sectors, many of which have global reach."
,"
Currently, IA has no software solution to meet their needs of facilitating networking between grantees and mentors and tracking key mentoring activities. IA staff must personally introduce grantees and mentors. Tracking/logging processes require significant time and do not benefit from efficient methods for adding and distributing information regarding key mentoring activities."
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team aims to create a social network bringing together grantees, mentors, corporate innovation partners, and governmental agencies in a way that publicizes, promotes, and commercially advances the innovations supported by federal grants. This solution will facilitate networking between the aforementioned persons, and enable the government and IA to track the activities of grantees and mentors to promote the successful commercialization of clients."

The Joslyn Institute currently utilizes a manual graphical tool to help convey the sustainability of a community. The graphic representation, called EcoSTEP, is an ideal tool for collaborative planning and communicating a region's, or project's progress toward a sustainable vision and quality of life goals. However, for maximum efficiency and replication, the tool needs to be automated and synchronized with typical ""sustainability indicator"" databases.  "
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will deliver a computerized version of the EcoSTEP tool. The completion of this application is an important step for the Joslyn Institute to distribute the results of their research and work. The application will enable the user to plan holistically with definable, measureable, and interdependent metrics, and be distributable anywhere there is interest and the ability to use it."

The proposed solution is to convert these applications to Portal technology. This will allow Mutual to maintain and build off of the new system in a way that will meet its long-term goals. Mutual is open to improvement or restructuring in Group Web Reporting while it sees Billing and Account Maintenance being a straight conversion to Portal."
,"The enhancements to the login functionality will allow for a more convenient experience for users who represent multiple groups.

,"Profile: The mission of the University of Nebraska Press, founded in 1941, is to encourage, develop, publish, and disseminate research, literature, and the publishing arts. The Press publishes writers and scholars, including those within the University of Nebraska system, and promotes projects on the culture of the state and of the entire West. It is one of the top ten university presses in the nation in terms of annual sales volume, and is one of the largest state university presses in the nation in terms of titles published."
,"Problem: For the University of Nebraska Press Web Enhancements Project, a team of six students in the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management Design Studio is working closely with the University of Nebraska Press to streamline and update the Press' e- commerce web site. The current web site lets users browse through and purchase books the Press publishes, but it is not easy to use, does not provide current product data, and lacks such functionality as calculating sales tax, applying discount codes, and ordering journals."
,"Solution: The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team is enhancing the current web site by implementing a new graphical design, enabling the automatic update of product information, updating and improving the shopping cart functionality, and adding journal subscriptions."

,"
Crete Carrier Corporation was founded in 1966 in Crete, Nebraska. Crete currently provides transporting services in 48 states as well as Washington DC with revenues exceeding $1 billion in 2008. Trucking operations include dry van and temperature control. In recent years, Crete has also acquired Shaffer Trucking and Hunt Transportation to expand its temperature control and flat-bed services. "
,"
Due to the inherent complexity of the trucking industry, there is no concrete mathematical algorithm for deriving accurate pricing models. At present, Crete has implemented heuristic methods entirely dependent on historical information to provide sales associates with recommended rates. The addition of real-time information and automation of back-end processes are needed to improve the quality and usability of provided quotes. There is also a desire to centralize reporting services and develop a customizable delivery method.   "

,"Profile: The Nebraska Animal Verification Enhancement (NAVE) project is a collaborative effort of the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management Software Design Studio and the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. The NAVE team has developed software that will allow the state's livestock producers to automatically track animal locations throughout the life cycle, enabling animal health officials to trace the location of any animal in the event of a foreign animal disease outbreak. This ""traceback"" is expected to take less than 48 hours, instead of weeks, helping to mitigate a potential catastrophe."
,Solution: Team members have worked closely with state and federal officials to implement Nebraska's portion of the US Animal Identification Program (USAIP); the NAVE team is building for Nebraska the first all-new USAIP-compliant system in the country. This system will give the nation's food supply and Nebraska's beef industry an additional measure of safety and security.

,"Profile: Lincoln Electric System provides power for over 117,000 customers in the city of Lincoln and surrounding areas. This is the third straight year LES has presented a new problem for Design Studio to tackle, and we have been up to the challenge."
,"Problem: LES has an interactive voice recognition system that matches telephone calls about power outages to customer accounts and their respective addresses. This information is stored in a database and presented in a powerful geographical information system. However, only LES technical operations staff has access to this GIS system. In order for managers and public relations staff to get information about a power outage, they must personally call the operations staff."
,"Solution: We are providing LES with a way to view the outage information over the web. LES managers and PR staff will be able to see a map showing the concentration of power outages in the Lincoln area. The map can be viewed to show the current or previous outage situation, and there will be an animation feature that will show outages over time. There will also be a page showing various power outage statistics. Additionally, we are providing LES with a desktop alert system that will alert LES managers and PR staff when an outage is occurring."

,"Sandhills Publishing: Sandhills Publishing is an information processing company. Sandhills Publishing's trade publications are industry leaders in their respective market segments. These market segments include trucking, construction, agriculture, computing and aviation. In addition to these publications, Sandhills Publishing creates value for its customers by collecting information at machinery auctions around the country and providing inventory management solutions to equipment dealers."
,"Project Opportunity One: Currently, Sandhills Publishing representatives use a Mobile Auction Results Module dependent on a web interface and a persistent data connection to collect auction data. However, when a data connection is not present, representatives must manually record the information and report it to Sandhills Publishing by phone. Speed and accuracy can be improved by using an installed application to track auction results in the absence of a data connection."
,Project Opportunity Two: Present implement dealer subscribers integrate inventory management with other services provided by Sandhills Publishing. The current solution includes input through a web form and non-standard data imports. This system's usability and speed can be improved by providing an enhanced mobile inventory management entry and review application.
,"Project Solution: The Design Studio team will produce two mobile applications-one for auction representatives who often must resort to ""pen-and-paper"" data collection and another for equipment dealers who currently use the Sandhills Publishing inventory management system. Both solutions will work in the absence of a wireless data connection through the development of a mobile communications framework."

,"Project Profile: Mutual of Omaha's Customer Access provides policyholders access to insurance policy information through a system accessible via the World Wide Web. The site enables policyholders to modify personal or policy information as needed. Approximately 49,000 policyholders have access to the system. This figure is growing at an average rate of 1,200 per month. Mutual of Omaha is looking to the Design Studio team to provide recommendations for reorganizing Customer Access. The last major update to Customer Access, completed in 2004, was a Design Studio project which enabled online payment options. Mutual of Omaha is asking the Design Studio team to research areas of possible site improvement by benchmarking top insurance company sites and evaluating industry standards and best practices. Based on the research, the team will develop an Implementation Plan for Mutual of Omaha. The Implementation Plan will follow incremental steps to lead to the overall reorganization of Customer Access. The Design Studio team will then design, code, and test the first increment."
,Project Goal: The Design Studio team is working with Mutual of Omaha to reorganize the Customer Access system's process flow as well as its look and feel. The Implementation Plan will give Mutual of Omaha the insight necessary to provide an application that will lead to increased customer satisfaction and self service.

Celebrating 25 years of partnership and service to the financial services industry, Fiserv is a leader in financial services technology solutions, driving innovation in Payments, Processing Services, Risk & Compliance, Customer & Channel Management, and Business Intelligence & Optimization. A Fortune 500 company, Fiserv is ranked No. 1 on the FinTech 100 survey of top partners to the financial services industry and winner of the 2008 Information Week 500 banking and financial services category."
,"
Fiserv would like to change the way banking customer service representatives look up customer information using its software. The current system often requires bank staff to make several clicks before they find an answer. Fiserv wants to develop a more intuitive search method that will simplify the process and produce faster results, reducing customer service response time. "
,"
The Raikes School Design Studio team will create a search tool that presents relevant financial data in an efficient manner, helping banking customer service representatives serve customers more quickly and effectively. The solution will track financial information in real time."

Cerner is a global supplier of healthcare solutions. Working together with more than 8,000 clients worldwide, Cerner is solving healthcare's many challenges by making sure the right people have the right information at the right time.  Since 1979, Cerner's three founders, Neal Patterson, Cliff Illig and Paul Gorup have focused on building a healthcare company that creates unmatched value for its clients."
,"
The dynamic and unfamiliar setting of the hospital environment poses multiple challenges in regards to navigation.  Patients, family members, staff, consulting healthcare professionals, and visitors often find themselves in a position where they are unable to locate specific places. Currently, visitors and staff have to rely on confusing maps, verbal instructions, and memory for navigation purposes. "
,"
In addition to effectively navigating the hospital environment, effective communication and presentation of clinical data to the clinician is imperative to ensure accurate patient care decisions are made.   

			"
,"
The UNL Cerner Design Studio team will develop a Navigation/""Nurse's Brain"" ""iGo"" Companion that will assist with locating a person, place, or thing, and provide a nursing-based Clinical Patient Summary that will assist the nurse with making appropriate clinical decisions."
,"
The solution will first be developed as a web application to be viewed on a variety of mobile devices and later as an iPhone specific application. Users will use an intuitive interface to find people, places, or things in a dynamic real time environment."

,"Profile: Mutual of Omaha is a financial services company that provides a diverse range of insurance products and services. Founded in 1909, they employ over 6,600 people today. Mutual of Omaha provides financial security to its customers so that they may care for themselves and/or their families in difficult times. This the third consecutive year Mutual of Omaha has partnered with the J.D. Edwards Design Studio to develop a technological solution that will improve the efficiency of their operations."
,"Problem/Opportunity: Mutual of Omaha's Retirement Plans Division currently utilizes a legacy mainframe pricing system to facilitate the Single Premium Group (SPG) and Terminal Funding Annuity (TFA) underwriting, quoting, and pricing process. This system does not provide the levels of flexibility, usability, efficiency nor features necessary to provide accurate quotes in as timely a manner as is desirable."
,"Solution: The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team is working with Mutual of Omaha to redesign the SPG and TFA pricing system. The new system will create a streamlined data import process, provide the ability to store and rerun pricing scenarios, and automate the data clean-up process, all of which will help to make Mutual of Omaha's Group Benefit Services division's pricing more competitive. In addition, the new, flexible system will move operations from the existing mainframe environment into a PC-based environment."
,Benefits: The pricing system will increase efficiency through less manual data entry and manipulation and an improved user interface. Specific benefits include:
," 1. The number of alternative interest rates considered in developing a yield curve will be increased from four to twelve.,
				    2. The database will store pricing scenarios, dramatically increasing the efficiency for adding additional scenarios once the initial scenario has been completed.,
				    3. Manual data manipulation will be significantly reduced with no manual data manipulation required for 90% of the cases.,
				    4. The system will also improve competitiveness by allowing multiple pricing scenarios to be run simultaneously."

,"Ciscare: Ciscare was founded in May 2005 by Sam Caughron, M.D., with the goal of improving information technology in the healthcare industry. Dr. Caughron developed Ciscare's flagship product, LARA (Live Anywhere Record Access), during his residency. Ciscare focuses on quality user interface design and the application of mobile devices in order to streamline physician workflow. LARA eliminates the need to print patient charts and delivers up-to-date patient data securely to PDAs. This system is currently in use at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, NE."

,"Current System: LARA provides read-only access to a hospital's Health Information System (HIS). It delivers data securely using WiFi and HTTP/SSL to a PDA web browser. It is not currently possible to electronically place orders through LARA. Orders continue to be prepared and distributed manually. The greatest flaw of this current method is handwriting misinterpretation. This could lead to errors and increased costs associated with incorrect orders, such as increased patient stays and lawsuits."
,"Proposed System: The new mobile electronic physician ordering system will allow physicians to place orders from any location within the hospital using a handheld PDA device. From within the easy-to-use interface, the user will be able to submit orders for medication or procedures. This system will be implemented for customers of Ciscare, most notably Creighton University Medical Center."

,"Profile: The mission of EADP is to ensure that hiring individuals and members of search committees understand and apply the University's commitment to diversity, affirmative action, and best practice principles. EADP verifies that all UNL, federal and state mandates are met. As per agreement with the Office of Civil Rights and University policy, hiring personnel and search committee members must receive orientation training and must have current certification."
,"Problem/Opportunity: While situated predominately in Lincoln, UNL spreads across two main campuses and has other facilities located across the state. All individuals involved with the hiring of new employees must be certified. Currently, training sessions are regularly held in Lincoln and trainees must adjust their schedules to attend orientation. This requires significant time and cost for those outside of Lincoln and inconvenience for those in Lincoln."
,"Solution: The J.D. Edwards Design Studio students and their partners at EADP are developing an on-line, multi-media system that will allow personnel to be trained at their convenience. The system will be available both on and off-campus so that hiring and search committee personnel do not need to travel to Lincoln or be available at a specific time for the orientation sessions."
,Benefits:
," 1. The system will save EADP approximately 5-15 hours per month in trainer preparation and delivery time,
				      2. The system will be accessible from any computer with an Internet connection, thereby enabling search committee members to take the required training at their convenience. This makes it possible to reduce or eliminate travel time, and to begin and end sessions at any time and even split the session if necessary. It will also eliminate the preparation tasks associated with coordinating face-to-face training sessions.,
				      3. The system will ensure that the training is complete and consistent since all content is stored within the system and presented in every training session.,
				      4. The system will ensure that trainees understand the course material through an integrated comprehension testing component.,
				      5. Trainee attendance and performance will be automatically tracked and easily accessible by EADP.,
				      6. The system will provide equal access to all members of the UNL community by insuring that those with disabilities, such as color blindness, will be able to readily use the system."

,"Design Data: Design Data produces innovative software for the steel industry's fabrication, detailing and engineering sectors. Their core product, SDS/2, provides connection design, automatic detailing, and engineering fabrication information thus reducing the time required to design, detail, fabricate and erect steel. Part of SDS/2 users' workflow is to provide information to project engineers and on-site erectors. One way this is done is by giving engineers and erectors access to a job model database via the World Wide Web. Through this interface, a user at a remote site can lookup important information with very little software installed at their end."

,"The current system uses outdated technology and there are limitations to its functionality, scalability and user friendliness."
,"Project Solution:The primary goal of the Design Studio team is to create a new product, Web Review Station. This product will provide users of Design Data's SDS/2 software with an efficient, easy-to-use means of accessing job model databases via the World Wide Web. Project work will focus on updating the web-based 3D model viewer component of SDS/2. The system will improve upon the current solution by offering:"
," Better efficency and scalability,
				   A superior user-friendly interface,
				   Additional interoperability"
,"These improvements will enhance performance of the design-build process, cut the time associated with making a request for information, and prevent miscommunication between engineers and detailers that could lead to structural failures. "

,"Profile: LES is a publicly owned utility providing electricity to 120,000 customers in the Lincoln area. Their mission is ï¿½To provide energy and services of superior value and enhance growth and development of the greater Lincoln area.ï¿½ Six divisions carry out this mission: Administration, Power Supply, Engineering, Operations, Finance & Accounting, and Consumer Services. This is the fourth consecutive year LES has presented a new challenge for Design Studio to solve."
,"Problem/Opportunity: Lincoln Electric System has several methods of generating electricity for its customers. One such method involves purchasing natural gas. Tracking purchases becomes difficult since they are made through multiple contracts, many of which run three years into the future. Support is also needed to help determine which contracts provide the greatest benefit for the purchase or sale of natural gas at any given time."
,"Solution: The Design Studio team is developing a Gas Transaction System (GTS) that will provide decision-makers with relevant information that is both up-to-date and easily accessible. This centralized, web-accessible, transaction management system will allow both the entry and review of data related to gas contracts and electricity usage. The reporting provided by the system includes tables and interactive charts with sorting and filtering functions."
,"Benefits: This decision support system will enable Lincoln Electric System to operate more efficiently and help them make more informed decisions with respect to natural gas purchases. Ultimately, this will help keep electricity costs low for LES customers."

,"Teams from Lincoln Electric System and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management Design Studio are working together on an Information Technology project for LES. This project, the Central Log Analysis System, involves both teams creating software that will allow LES to monitor security logs coming from their web hardware."
,"Deborah Eagan, LES Security Coordinator, talks about our program: ""Design Studio follows tried and true project management practices while developing software. I have found the students to be eager and quite capable. They aren't afraid to tackle something new and dig in to find out how it works. They bring fresh perspective and enthusiasm to the job. It's fun to observe the pride of accomplishment as the project progresses through planning and design to a working prototype. I found the experience valuable and rewarding not only because we hope to receive the results of a successful project but also because we get to watch a team of students developing the skills needed to be successful in the workplace. Many of us recognize that technical skills are only one part of being successful on the job. The ability to collaborate with others is critical to success of a team."""
,"This software will allow LES to be aware of any security violations to their systems. In addition, this software will identify these violations in a matter of minutes; the old system of manual log checking would take several hours. The speed of the C.L.A.S. will increase the level of security at LES, while reducing the workload for the system administrators and reducing system downtime. This unique software system is not available in any store, and can only be custom built by software engineers. The J.D. Edwards Design Studio is a perfect fit"

,"CSG intends to deliver a Business Intelligence solution called CSG Intelligent Business Reporting (IBR) to its clients.Â Â  This new product extension of Vantage will help evolve CSG's current reporting solution to a next generation, web-based BI tool.Â  This solution will help grow our current IT user base of 1100 users to thousands of business users (CSG forecast is ~5000 additional users).Â  IBR will allow business users direct access to critical data so they can manage their operations without requiring SQL or a thick client developer's tool.Â  CSG believes if the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management can generate an intuitive, easy to use reporting solution, CSG can gain a significant competitive advantage over their competitors and increase client satisfaction. "
,"The Intelligent Business Reporting system will allow CSG to reach many new users directly that will not be required to understand SQL or the billing system in detail.Â  CSG estimates an additional 5000 users will be reached by this new system.Â  In addition, CSG will be able to more efficiently process queries based on data organized according to clients' expected/pre-determined behavior."

,"Due to recent cuts in the state budget, many school districts in rural Nebraska are having to reduce their costs in undesirable ways, such as eliminating programs or faculty. GIS Workshop and the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management in Computer Science and Management Design Studio are developing a software system that will enable schools to save money by reducing the costs associated with school bus transportation."
,"The system determines the quickest and safest route for a bus to take, thereby reducing the amount of gasoline consumed, as well as the time-on-the-clock for the driver. The cutting-edge algorithm was developed after months of research into various techniques recently developed by several top mathematicians. The system is comprised of several GIS software components. This enables administrators to identify locations where students should be picked up, and automatically incorporates that point into the route. This system also reduces the time administrators spend on planning routes.,
				      Future Opportunities"
,"In the future, GIS Workshop hopes to extend the project by adding Automatic Vehicle Locators to each bus, which would provide parents with up-to-the-minute information on the location of their child's bus via the Internet. "

,"Profile: The External Affairs group within the University of Nebraska's Office of the President is responsible for planning, coordinating, and tracking a large number of special events each year. In order to successfully manage these events, the group uses a database of contacts to send invitations and information to University supports across the State and the nation, and to record details about the event."
," , "
,"The Design Studio at the JD Edwards Honors Program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is designing and developing the Codename SWISS system for i2rd (Interactive Information R&D), a local software research and development firm. SWISS is a content management system at heart, but it's much more than that-with innovative capabilities of information customization and distribution unlike anything available today, SWISS has the real potential to add incredible value to nearly any organization."

,Problem/Opportunity: The current database used by the External Affairs group requires a significant amount of manual labor in order to interact with contacts and maintain contact information. This makes it difficult to maintain accurate and complete information for the large number of contacts and the numerous events held each year. The current database also lacks sufficient flexibility to integrate information from other sources.
,"Solution: The J.D. Edwards Design Studio team is working with the External Affairs group to design and construct a new contact management system. The new ""NUContact"" system will feature a web-based interface and a new database that will be used to store and manage user, contact and event data."
,"Benefits: The new ""NU Contact"" system will provide a central location for collecting and storing contact data and will help in event management, contact management, data mining, and reporting."
,The new system will address the needs of the President's Office by providing:
," 1. Centralized data storage for their information (contacts, NU events, and demographic information),
				    2. An easy-to-use interface for event planning and contact management.,
				    3. An efficient query and report interface.,
				    4. Better data organization via categorization and standardization.,
				    5. A more flexible design that will support integration with information from other sources."
,Technologies:
,"  Microsoft SQL (MSSQL),
				     Microsoft ASP.NET,
				     C#,
			      HTML"

,"SWISS allows organizations that sell information services, such as human resources companies, law offices, and a diverse spectrum of other groups to distribute that information to clients with significantly greater efficiency. Service can be customized to meet the needs of individual clients, yet at the same time SWISS allows the providers to provide new information to their customers instantaneously. In the past, content writing and development for hundreds or even thousands of clients was an insurmountable task, even with a content management system. SWISS eliminates redundancy and makes distribution automatic, increasing a firm's revenues for each new client, and significantly reducing maintenance costs.,
			      ...created through collaboration between industry and the academic world"
,"The JD Edwards Design Studio and i2rd have collaborated together throughout the project design process, and the result is a product design that combines the strengths of today's new technologies with contemporary software engineering practices. We are confident that, at the end of the semester, i2rd will find that the collective minds of these eight students will have helped them create a product that is stronger, more durable, and even more revolutionary.,
			      SWISS At A Glance"
,"SWISS is a multi-tier system that includes client-side software on the side of the content provider, a thin-client interface for the content provider's customers, server components, a database that encompasses all of the content that the system is managing, and XML data query and response services."
,"The current SWISS system utilizes a wide variety of technologies, including:"
," Java,
				      Servlets,
				      Tomcat Java Server Pages,
				      MySQL,
				      XML,
				      XSLT"
