            If you want to change the world, you have come to the right place! Here in the Raikes School we believe in learning by doing and that changing the world in the 21st century starts with understanding business and computer science.  Every day our students are engaged in numerous interdisciplinary software and business development projects supported by a world-class faculty. We are on the front lines of what’s next; from supporting research efforts to feed the worlds growing population to understanding the complex relationships that connect customers and marketplaces. By
            teaching a combination of complex analytical models and human-centered design processes, we are
            giving the leaders of tomorrow the skills they need to leverage opportunities, solve wicked problems and bring to market
            innovative products and services.
    "
,"
            In partnership with the ,, the Colleges of ,, ,, ,, and , we offer courses that teach students the foundations of computer science, management, and software engineering. Our project-oriented curriculum develops in our students a deep understanding of the complex models that drive each discipline and exposes them to design processes like lean and agile to bring an iterative and human-centered approach to analytical problem solving. The core of who we are and what we teach lives at the intersection of business, technology, and design; and it is supported by a deep understanding of quantitative models from across disciplines. Our graduates have gone on to start companies like Hudl, Boutique Window, Allied Strategy, and Med XT. They lead teams at companies like Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, and Google. They go on to receive graduate degrees from leading institutions like Harvard and Carnegie Mellon University. The Raikes School is paving the way in the development of the next generation of innovative leaders.

,"The Raikes School is a competitive place. Nobody knows that better than Cody Ebberson.
"
,"
“I was not accepted into the Raikes School my freshman year. I went to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology instead. I wanted to attend the Raikes School but it was too prestigious. I thought the program was awesome. I liked the people. I liked the business technology integrated curriculum. I was all in—but I didn’t get accepted.”
"
,"
Fortunately, things have a way of working themselves out. Because following Cody’s freshman year at Rose-Hulman, Cody reapplied and was accepted into the Raikes School.
"
,"
“Despite being at a top ranked engineering program, I was concerned that I was ‘missing out’ of the more well-rounded Raikes School education. I wanted that integrated business technology experience. It was something that really captured my imagination.”
"
,"
Following his graduation in 2004, Cody was hired by Microsoft to be one of the founding engineers on the Microsoft Virtual Earth team—now known as Bing Maps. After three years at Microsoft, Cody left to attend Harvard Business School where he received his MBA in strategy, technology, and entrepreneurship. Next came roles at 24/7 Radiology, an international teleradiology provider, and Numenta, an artificial intelligence research and development group. Finally, in 2012, Cody started his own company—MedXT, a firm providing big data and analytic solutions for medical imaging groups.
"
,"
“We live in an increasingly competitive world and it’s harder than ever to distinguish yourself. The Raikes School provided a number of experiences that gave me an edge. In particular, my time as a Design Studio team leader prepared me for the challenges of managing a team of people. It helped me secure a lead position at Microsoft within my first year.”
"
,"
Ten years later, Cody looks back fondly on his Raikes School experience. “The Raikes School was a transformative experience that set me up for a successful career in technology leadership. I joined the Raikes School back when the program was just beginning because I believed in a vision of a new paradigm of education—a radical idea of cross training students in business and technology.”
"
,"
“The vision is coming to life. And the radical idea doesn’t seem so radical anymore. I’m proud to have been a part of the Raikes School’s past. I’m inspired by the students of today. And I’m very excited to see what the future holds for the next generation of Raikes School graduates.”

Last fall, Raikes School students James Verhoeff and Zach Christensen were dining out with friends when they realized they had forgotten their coupon cards. While frustrated by their forgetfulness, the two were also dumbfounded that in 2013 their coupon card had yet to go digital—they saw an opportunity. Following discussions with existing coupon programs, James and Zach made the decision to create a unique platform of their own.
"
,"
On February 4, 2013, Pickit was launched.
"
,"
Pickit is a mobile app that allows users to pick nonprofits they want to support, and every time they redeem a promotion offered by a Pickit merchant, half of Pickit’s commission gets donated to the nonprofit that user ‘picked’. 
"
,"
According to James, the decision to involve nonprofits was a no-brainer. “I have worked for a nonprofit for about a year, and Zach had originally wanted to start a nonprofit. It was a leap of faith to make this commitment, but we believe that faithful stewardship pays off…Pickit is about revolutionizing the way that nonprofits go about fundraising by making it part of your everyday transaction.”
"
,"
James and Zach credit the faculty and staff of the Raikes School for their company’s initial success. “The Raikes School has been immensely helpful in this process by providing mentorship and advice. The Raikes School went as far as to give us an office for the year, tickets to Big KC and Big Omaha, printing for sales materials to explore new markets, consistent mentorship and advice—like how to do payroll and pay taxes, and huge help on the iPhone app. The Raikes School has opened more doors than I could ever have imagined.”
"
,"
Today, Pickit’s client list has grown to 56 merchants and 28 nonprofit organizations in the greater Lincoln community. In March of 2013, James and Zach were awarded the grand prize at the 2013 UNL New Venture Competition receiving $50,000 to invest in Pickit. They have elected to use a portion of their winnings to take part in the Spring 2014 Design Studio—as a client.
"
,"
“We’re really excited,” remarks James. “It feels like our dream is finally becoming a reality.”

If you ask David Keck how he would define the Raikes School, you had better have a pen and paper handy.

“The Raikes School is a total immersion over four years in interdisciplinary, innovative design and development with an academic focus on computer science and management.”
"
,"
It sounds simple at first. But then Keck goes on.
"
,"
“Academically, our focus is computer science and management—that’s what our students formally get degrees in. However, more and more, we’re looking between the topics. Computer science and management was our original mandate, but in between those two disciplines is where interdisciplinary design and innovation really reside.”
"
,"
Sound a little unconventional? It is. And the Raikes School wouldn’t have it any other way.
"
,"
Established in 1999 as a joint venture between the University of Nebraska – Lincoln’s College of Business Administration and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Raikes School is an honors program with a mission to develop world-class innovators and leaders through honors education. Nestled inside the university’s Kauffman Center, the program offers a unique living and learning community that enables students to freely engage in collaborative project work via student residences, faculty offices, project work areas and meeting rooms.
"
,"
Boasting a 7:1 student-to-faculty ratio and a mean ACT score of 33.7, the Raikes School is drawing the nation’s best and brightest minds to Lincoln, Nebraska. But it’s once they’re inside Kauffman that the real magic happens. Students embark on a four-year core curriculum consisting of honors computer science, business and management topics, as well as leadership, team and communication skills development teachings.
"
,"
Expounding on the Raikes School’s standing as a hub of interdisciplinary innovation, Keck states, “When we say ‘design thinking,’ we’re talking about processes that are interdisciplinary and repeatable. You hear people say, ‘We’re going to be creative and think outside-of-the-box.’ But without a repeatable process that helps you understand the need, or the gap, you’re not going to achieve an innovation.”
"
,"
“At the Raikes School, we’re preparing students to become innovators—not just saying so.”

,"David Graff has two great passions in life—sports and technology. In 2004, those passions landed David, then a Raikes School student, an internship working for the University of Nebraska’s Sports Information Department, assisting with football stats and recruiting.

,"Back at Kauffman, David examined these shortcomings with his neighbors and Raikes School classmates, Brian Kaiser and John Wirtz. Together, the three friends saw an opportunity."
,"They immediately began working together to create a solution that addressed all of the coaching staff’s issues. Following months of work, David, John, and Brian presented their solution—dubbed “Hudl”—to the football coaching staff. They loved it. It was 2006 and Hudl had their first paying client."
,"Today, Hudl works with approximately 20,000 clients worldwide, offering web-based video analysis and coaching tools to 10 NFL teams, eight NHL teams, two NBA teams, 83 Division I college football teams, and 80% of the nation’s high school football teams. They are the unparalleled leader in the sports video analysis realm. And according to David, their success can be immediately traced back to their time at the Raikes School."
,"“The Raikes School, specifically Design Studio, was extremely valuable in helping us make the transition to running a company directly from college. We learned a lot about handing real-world projects, managing timelines, and delivering for customers. Also, I think the connections were incredible, both through the alumni network and the Board of Advisors. There were a lot of people we were able to lean on for advice in getting a business together—people who’ve had a lot of success.”"
,"Since graduating in 2006, David has stayed in close connection with the Raikes School by employing a number of Raikes School graduates and interns, as well as becoming involved with the Design Studio process as a sponsor organization on three occasions. “We think the value is there for our business. It’s a great opportunity to interact with potential hires and get your name high on the mind of the juniors and seniors in the program.”"

Most college seniors would give anything to list just one of these industry-leading corporations on their post college resume. Thanks to their Design Studio experience, graduates of the Raikes School enter the workforce with two, and in some instances three, of them.
"
,"
“Design Studio provides an opportunity to accelerate your career growth,” remarks Ian Cottingham, associate director for Design Studio.
"
,"
“We’ve tried to make our partner portfolio diverse enough that it caters to the needs of all of our students. Over the years, we’ve been fortunate to have a lot of different corporate partners. From small startups, like Hudl and Nebraska Global, all the way to large corporations—Microsoft has done 10 projects with us and they’re set to do another this year.”
"
,"
Oh, the perks of genius.
"
,"
Started in 2000, Design Studio serves as the capstone learning experience of the Raikes School. Occurring over the course of students’ junior and senior years, Design Studio offers students the opportunity to collaborate with sponsoring organization to develop software-based solutions aimed at solving real-world business problems.
"
,"
“Essentially, Design Studio offers students the opportunity to put into practice everything they have learned while in the Raikes School,” notes Cottingham. “Industry partners come to us with these ideas—these problems they need solved. And through Design Studio, they get a team of some of the brightest students on campus to help them solve these problems.”
"
,"
Implementing the principles of creative problem solving and interdisciplinary design thinking, each Design Studio team is comprised of students with various majors and perspectives.

""We don’t just want computer scientists and software developers. We want people who can really think creatively about solutions to problems.”
"
,"
In addition to teamwork skills, students develop project management and leadership experience essential in today’s professional world, as well as the opportunity to form key connections with top local and national companies. But above all else, according to Cottingham, Design Studio provides students the opportunity to learn what can only be learned through experience—not from a lecture or a textbook.
"
,"
""What’s unique about Design Studio is that we accomplish hands-on learning without the learning part getting in the way. We don’t put constraints on the students. We give them the freedom to explore their projects, to explore their ideas, and in some sense, to explore their skill sets.”

,"When it comes to sports, Raikes School student Travis Schreier cares more about having fun than he does about winning trophies. But that’s not to say Travis doesn’t like to win.
"
,"
“Oh, I’m definitely a competitive person,” says the Esther’s Crew manager with a slight chuckle.
"
,"
Esther’s Crew, named after their building’s namesake, Esther L. Kauffman, is the intramural activities team for all Raikes School students living in the Kauffman Center.
"
,"
Regarded as one of the campuses most active intramural teams, Esther’s Crew competes in a wide variety of men’s, women’s, and co-rec activities. In fact, according to Travis, it would be difficult to find one event where Esther’s Crew doesn’t have a participant. “From broomball to flag football and foosball to pitch tournaments, Esther’s Crew teammates are always a part of the action.”

Since their formation in 2002, Esther’s Crew has been more than ‘a part of the action.’ They’ve been champions of it. Winners of countless intramural contests, as well as several year-long all-university competitions, including flag football, volleyball, ultimate Frisbee and softball, the crew from Kauffman have done more than enough over the last 11 years to solidify their reputation as intramural all-stars.
"
,"
“You have to have a pretty competitive nature to get into the Raikes School because it’s a very competitive program. And if you’re not going to go for it, and put yourself out there, you’re not going to be able to make it in this program. That’s not to say that students outside of the Raikes School aren’t competitive, but we’re definitely the more competitive team out there. We try really hard. We compete very well. And we usually do pretty well.”
"
,"
To this point, Travis credits the Raikes School’s unique blend of competition and camaraderie. “With Esther’s Crew being made up of Raikes School students, you’re playing with a lot of your classmates. It’s just another way to build teamwork and communication skills. I see people on the volleyball court or on the football field and gain a better understanding of how they work and I can translate that to when we’re working on group projects—which are a big part of the Raikes School experience.”

"
,"No one seems to remember exactly how it happened.  
"
,"
They know it started with a Silicon Prairie News story about the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management last December. There was some talk around the College of Architecture, an e-mail from interim dean Kim Wilson to Raikes director Dr. David Keck with a link to the story. 
"
,"
However it began, it's finally happening this semester—Dr. Keck's vision for incorporating ""design thinking"" and its interdisciplinary principles into the Raikes curriculum is coming to fruition with a joint course taught by Ian Cottingham and Brian Kelly.  
"
,"
As Cottingham explained, ""the properties are exactly the same in terms of designing a coffee cup as designing a software program.""  
"
,"
Yet, Kelly says ""this course is about designing an idea and not necessarily designing a product,"" which he notes is a major shift in thinking for the College of Architecture.
"
,"
The course, which is required for all 36 Raikes and approximately 150 architecture freshmen students, focuses on the ""process"" of innovation, rather than the ""product."" The students learn the five steps of the design thinking—empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test—and repeat them in four projects, each of which gets progressively more abstract and more externally-focused, with more emphasis on the broader community. The first assignment involved defining each student team's aggregate identity, while the second asked students to improve the campus dining halls.
"
,"
In essence, the course teaches students how to approach and solve ""a problem that seems extremely daunting when you look at it, that you just don't know how to do it,"" Kelly (right) said.   
"
,"
It's not easy to mold the ""spirit within the student"" and inspire them to be ""aspirational about something."" Some have struggled, so far, to break out of the habit of being graded on results, instead of how they get there. But Kelly said he's having ""vastly different"" conversations with his first-year students than ever before.  
"
,"
Which is precisely the goal: ""At some point in your college career, you have to make a transition from how to be a good student to how to be good at your discipline or field,"" Cottingham (left) said, and ""to understand that rules don't always apply.""  
"
,"
He went as far as to paraphrase Marc Ecko's 2013 Big Omaha talk: ""Learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist."" 
"
,"
Keck, Cottingham and Kelly are excited to see what comes from getting students on track with design thinking so early in their college careers, how it will impact the Raikes School's Design Studio when these freshmen become juniors and seniors, and how design thinking might spread across campus and better the community.  
"
,"
""We're in the middle of a very successful experiment, but it's still an experiment,"" Cottingham said. 
"
,"
""It's a prototype,"" Kelly agreed.  
"
,"
""It would be phenomenal if every department offered a 101D course in their first-year curriculum,"" Cottingham said.

Leo Glass should have known he would end up making video games one day, or so he says.
"
,"
Growing up on a farm in Valley, Neb., the youngest of 10 half-brothers and sisters, his early life consisted of chores and video games. His mother bought him his first game, a Coleco “Donkey Kong” Mini-Arcade, at a yard sale. He played it so much the battery acid began leaking out of the case.
"
,"
“From that point, as a kid, that was my life,” Glass said. “My introverted time was always spent with games. I consumed as much of that stuff as I could.”
"
,"
His best friends growing up were the people with whom he could share his video-gaming experiences. It wasn’t just a way to occupy his time; a good game was an emotional experience, one that taught him something.
"
,"
The closest thing to a life-changing experience Glass ever had with gaming was when he played “Deus Ex” as a sophomore in high school.
"
,"
“Everything I thought about the way action games were supposed to work, everything I thought about the way choice was supposed to work, was on its head,” he said. “If I wanted to be a total villain and do horrible things to people, the game allowed it. You might step on a rat, and you feel kinda bad because you hear that sickening crack. ‘Deus Ex’ was the first time that I thought, ‘I can impact the game world in an interesting way.’”
"
,"
Megan Vokal didn’t play lots of video games as a kid. The games she did play, she played all the time. Her favorites were simulators – more specifically, pet simulators. It wasn’t until she was a freshman in high school that gaming grew into an obsession, with the help of Nintendo consoles like the GameCube and Wii.
"
,"
By that point, Vokal knew she wanted to design games for a living. But being a “naive little brat,” she had little idea of the work necessary to accomplish such a goal. The first step was to learn how to code, so she enrolled in a programming class and began learning Java.
"
,"
“In the class description it said, ‘at the end of the year, you will make a game,’ which was ‘Pong,’” she said. “It was a super basic project but still a lot of fun.”
"
,"
She took two more years of Java classes and went on to enroll in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Jeffery S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management as a computer science major. She eventually found that her other interest, creative writing, was missing from her life. She wanted to find a career that would satisfy her interest in writing and programming.
"
,"
She realized that her high school pipe dream, video games, was the combination of storytelling and computer programming she had been looking for. But it would take playing a game she had missed out on as a child before she truly realized making games was the career for her.
"
,"
“I didn’t have a PS2 growing up, so I missed out on a lot of really great older games,” she said. “But a friend introduced me to ‘Shadow of the Colossus’ and it was the first time that I really saw games as what I consider to be art. That’s how someone can make a game and make it be a meaningful experience.”
"
,"
Caleb Moore was also a “Nintendo kid.” Like many, he was drawn to the unique art style and individuality of Nintendo games.
"
,"
And like many teens, video games were a social experience for Moore, as he began playing “Halo,” or trading Pokemon, with his friends.
"
,"
He eventually realized that his true passion wasn’t gaming, but music.
"
,"
“I still played games but I really loved the creative outlet music allowed me,” he said. “Music has a way of connecting and moving people without words and in deeper ways than words are often able to. I began to notice how connected music was with every quality entertainment experience I had.”
"
,"
Although he had gone “head over heels” into music, starting his own band, he chose to pursue an electrical engineering degree at Southeast Community College in Lincoln. He took a side job working in graphic design and decided to drop out of school and pursue design full time.
"
,"
After three years, Moore decided he wanted to do something more meaningful.
"
,"
At the same time Glass, who had received an English degree from UNL but had been designing training experiences for fraternity organizations for several years, quit his job in Colorado and returned to Nebraska with the goal of starting his own business and making video games.
"
,"
He chose to become a part of Turbine Flats, an “ideas community” of tech startups in Lincoln. It’s because of Turbine Flats that he met Vokal and Moore.
"
,"
Vokal had worked several software jobs, most recently with a Lincoln company called Semcat, which happens to be headquartered at Turbine Flats. She did this all while thinking that she would have to do her time at an AAA game developer before she would have the resources to focus on passion projects.
"
,"
And along comes Glass, with similarly unique ideas about what video games can be. It didn’t take long for them to realize they had a golden opportunity on their hands and Clockwork Demon was born.
"
,"
“At the same time, I’m talking about the types of sounds I want and evoking feelings,” Glass said. “And the office manager of ISoft (another Turbine Flats company) says, ‘My husband does that,’ and I was kind of blown away and that’s how we found Caleb.”
"
,"
As the trio struggled to get Clockwork Demon off the ground, they set their sights on a project that they eventually chose to shelf. It took tragedy striking for them to find the project that would serve to introduce them to gamers.
"
,"
“In October, I got married,” said Moore. “We went on our honeymoon and had a great time. When we got back my wife and I found out that our dog of five years had passed on in his sleep while we were gone. Obviously not a fun way to start off a marriage.”
"
,"
Reeling from the death of his Boston Terrier, Jackson, Moore created a short animation and showed it to his coworkers. Glass immediately began to wonder if it could become a game, the exact kind of game that could define Clockwork Demon’s identity from the get-go.
"
,"
“Our current project is exploring the gravity of human relationships through the lens of a dog,” Glass said. “And we’re excited because there’s a secret power that pets have in your life that doesn’t get explored much.”
"
,"
Glass has been consulting a dog behaviorist to ensure that their game’s playable character is as realistic as possible. After all, the whole point is to make people think about the way they interact with pets, and people, in their own lives. That concept applies to everything Clockwork Demon does and plans to do.
"
,"
“A phrase that Leo uses a lot, to the point that it sounds kind of buzzword-y, is ‘emotionally resonant games,’” Vokal said. “We want the games we make to explore parts of our human nature that a lot of games don’t explore. We wanna do that in a way that takes full advantage of the interactivity of the video game medium. There are some games that have a very linear story line that don’t explore choice or consequence. And we love those games, too. But we wanna make sure in our games that the player always feels like they have agency or a sense of control.”
"
,"
But ambitions require resources, the kinds of resources that an independent startup may find hard to come by. Clockwork Demon’s greatest challenges are not creative ones; as Glass said, they have no shortage of good ideas.
"
,"
Their challenges are the limitations of a three-man team, none of whom have worked in game development before. And if they want their game to sell well enough to warrant future games, they have to make themselves known.
"
,"
“For most indie games, it feels like marketing and PR is something that happens throughout the game, its lifetime,” Vokal said. “Because if no one knows who you are you can’t just say, ‘here’s our teaser trailer, here’s our release date, look for us in the next six months.’ You have to have a constant dialogue so that people will actually know that you exist and will actually wanna buy your game when it comes out.”
"
,"
Glass is confident that their projects will resonate with gamers.

University of Michigan and Santa Fe Institute Fellow Professor Scott Page will be the keynote speaker at the Raikes School Spring Advisory Board Invited Speakers lecture on April 25. Scott researches how diversity improves performance and decision making, when ‘diversity’ means what we look like on the outside, rather than what we look like within—the tools and abilities that make each of us unique. He will be discussing the important role that models can play in quantitative analysis of complex system.
"
,"
He is the author of The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies, about how we think in groups and why collective wisdom works.
Scott’s current book, Diversity and Complexity provides an introduction to the role of diversity in complex adaptive systems. He explains how diversity underpins system level robustness, allowing for multiple responses to external shocks and internal adaptations.
"
,"
Scott also studies complex systems. He is the author of Complex Adaptive Systems and is on the external faculty of the Santa Fe Institute, the world-renowned research center dedicated to using complexity science to solve human problems.
Scott is director of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan where he serves as Leonid Hurwicz Collegiate Professor of Complex Systems, Economics, and Political Science. He teaches two courses, Understanding Complexity and The Hidden Factor: Why Thinking Differently Is Your Greatest Asset on The Great Courses website. Scott received a 2013 Guggenheim Fellowship in Social Sciences/Political Science.

,"This course has three modules.  The first module covers a variety of economic concepts.  Each concept is tied back to innovation.  Topics include economic growth and the link between growth and innovation; resource limitation and allocation issues, and how they constrain innovation; costs and how they impact incentives to innovate; demand estimation and how it differs between existing and emerging markets.  Students are introduced to a variety of modeling techniques including constrained optimization, growth models, linear estimation and models of diffusion.  "
,"In the second module, students are introduced to linear optimization models, used for planning, production scheduling, transportation, and technology issues.  Linear programming has been applied in the area of economics and business operations specifically for planning, scheduling production, transportation and technology issues.  "
,"The third segment of the course addresses queuing theory, a mathematical method of predicting queue lengths and waiting times in lines or queues. This capacity management technique has been successfully applied in telecommunications, traffic engineering, predicting and managing shop floor operations in both manufacturing and service-oriented industry. Typical examples in service-oriented industry include banks, stores, hospitals and medical centers."

We are all creating all the time, both consciously and unconsciously, but our understanding of how, and our confidence in the process, can be mysterious or suppressed. The truth is that the best scientists, entrepreneurs, engineers, soldiers, CEOs, sports coaches, hockey players, and architects are all creative. Creativity includes being attuned to the people and culture you are immersed in and having the experience, wisdom, and knowledge to frame the real problem and more importantly the ability to create and enact solutions. In a time when creativity is the foundation for innovation, this course aims to prepare a generation of students to rise with the challenges of our times.
"
,"
This freshman course focuses on developing creative intelligence.  Intended for students with little or no design experience, the course introduces central issues and approaches to design as an interdisciplinary process. This process developed for students ranging in age from kindergarten to post-professionals at Stanford’s Hasso Platter Institute of Design, which has been called design thinking, draws on methods from engineering and design, and combines them with ideas from the arts, tools from the social sciences, and insights from the business world. At UNL, enrolled undergraduate students will work collaboratively using a design thinking process to address relevant and real-world challenges beyond the campus.
"
,"
During the semester students will be asked to utilize their creative problem-solving abilities to address challenges ranging from logo design to the application of design principles to better their community. The goal of the course is to teach design as a practice-defining method of creative innovation and to give students the tools they need to unlock their own creative genius. The process is intended to become a normal way of problem-solving, not the exception.

    In a live webcast in front of as many as 3,000 people across the nation on Feb. 15, students from the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management cheered after winning more than $58,000 in an app-development challenge.,
,
“Team Stock Bros” students Neema Bahramzad, Alec Johnston, Chris Johnson, Clay Upton and Derek Guenther will split most of the prize money won in a competition among 29 teams from universities across the country. A portion of the prize will also fund improvements at the Raikes School.,
,
The challenge required the development of unique investment apps using TradeKing’s Application Programming Interface. TradeKing is an online broker-dealer. Students worked on the development September through December 2011. The resulting apps took creative approaches to combining the TradeKing API with other APIs from websites such as Twitter, Yahoo and Google. ,
,
UNL was one of 29 teams competing, and made the finals. Other finalists were Loyola University Maryland, McKendree University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Villanova. By making the finals, the UNL team was guaranteed at least $3,000, or $5,000 as a runner-up. The finalist round on Feb. 15 featured a live interactive demonstration with the other finalists and judges.,
,
Team Stock Bros developed three apps: an Android phone app, a browser extension and a stock notification program. They won the midwest division plus the national prize. Another UNL team, Team WYSIWYG, developed a Windows 7 phone app -- and for their work won $1,500. ,
,
TradeKing CEO Don Montanaro was master of ceremonies in the hour-long online meeting, calling on each team to show their work and announcing first division winners, then the single national winner. ,
,
This first-of-its-kind challenge was created to drive a unique collaboration between academia and a financial services industry leader like TradeKing to foster creativity and awareness about innovative entrepreneurial possibilities around APIs. ,
,
“For an innovation-driven company like TradeKing, it was gratifying to see bright young minds realize their potential, take on the challenge and prove to themselves that with focus and hard work, they can cross every frontier,” said Don Montanaro, CEO and Chairman of TradeKing.  “Since September, I’ve watched closely as the Campus Challenge student teams worked diligently to understand the online brokerage industry and put their creative technical skills to work developing next generation apps to let investors learn and trade in innovative new ways. The breadth of the students’ imaginations translated into apps that strike at the very essence of what this competition was all about.”,
,
Montanaro said the challenge judges were impressed with the caliber of work submitted by the students, which made choosing the winners a difficult task, “but the Stock Bros team from the University of Nebraska created an impressive and functional application with the right combination of entrepreneurial spark, out-of-the-box thinking, real-world viability and skillful software development.,
,
“I congratulate the entire University of Nebraska-Lincoln community for the school’s performance in the API Campus Challenge.”,
 ,
Stock Bros created a unique platform that combines a Chrome Browser Plugin, Android Mobile application and cloud-based notification service to enable investors to interact with and trade via TradeKing from any website.  A user can select the equities for which they’d like to scan and, as they browse the web, a Google Chrome extension scans pages for those symbols and appends an interactive stock quote to the page. The user can then dive deeper to get a detailed quote, an interactive chart and the ability to place a trade with TradeKing.,
,
Customers want to subscribe to services from any and all destinations and devices in addition to traditional websites, TradeKing said; this app fills that role. ,
,
This unique application was implemented by creating a mashup between the TradeKing and Yahoo! Finance APIs.  From the browser extension, traders can further manage push notifications that are sent via their web service to the Android mobile application.  True to the idea of trading from anywhere, the application covers both the Browser and mobile delivery channels.  ,
,
Team WYSIWYG students, also from the Raikes School: Jessah Hofker, Cody Jung, and Emily West, developed a Windows 7 phone app that allows investors to place trades via the TradeKing API, monitor watchlists and track market changes.  It features convenient auto-completion functionality for symbol or company names via a connection through the Yahoo! API.  ,
,
“I think this is one of the most fun days we’ve had in Raikes School history,” director David Keck said. “It was definitely an experiment, stretching the bounds of educational methodology. The original idea was to figure out whether doing a national competition would increase engagement and the learning experience and it looks to me like it was all very successful.,
,
“The real goal wasn’t really the prize money ever, it was the experiment with the learning experience and to see what kind of engagement would come from doing a national competition,” he said. “The course ended two months ago, and the students are still talking about finance, looking at what other teams did across the country, so I think the engagement really was a big win.”,
Keck and the team were also glad to have Nebraska and the Raikes School stand out among some tough competition.,
,
“A lot of people were viewing that webcast and there really was a lot of leading edge apps being demoed. So I think it’s one more opportunity to put Nebraska on the map.,
,
“We did it tonight.” ,

                    Our curriculum isn't the only aspect of our academic model that stands out. Courses in the Raikes School are taught by a mix of resident faculty and consulting faculty from the College of Business Administration and Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Professors and lecturers incorporate a practitioner perspective in their approach to teaching. They work to ensure that students not only gain a deep understanding of the complex theories of computer science and management, but also understand how to put the knowledge they gain into practice to transform the industries and organizations in which they will work after graduation.

Amy Cyphers left the arid desert of Western Colorado to attend the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where –in addition to honing her skills in journalism -- she embraced all the “Good Life” has to offer (well, except maybe for humidity and wind chill). She spent 20 years in university and alumni communications before co-founding Girls on the Run of Nebraska, a nonprofit, youth-serving organization that aims to build strong and confident girls. Her communications background has been invaluable to her work as a nonprofit director.
Cyphers began teaching technical communication for the UNL College of Journalism and Mass Communications in 2004. Since 2005, she has taught introductory communications to first-year students in the Raikes School, where the student camaraderie often leads to lively classroom discussions. She enjoys working with students to perfect their assignments.

,"This course continues with more complex modeling techniques commonly used to address a variety of real-world issues.  The course begins with Markov Chains and Monte Carlo methods.  A Markov chain is a probability modeling and an approximation technique used to predict the future statistical state of a memory-less system. Monte Carlo method is a simulation technique based upon repeated random sampling.  Typical uses of these methods include inventory control, classification, estimation of sales demands over time, modeling project schedules, estimating sensitivity of systems to variation, and risk assessment in financial models, etc.  These modeling methods stimulate thinking while fueling innovation."
,"
Network models are discussed in this course as well.  These models are used to understand complex and emergent phenomenon in interconnected nodes forming a network. They further help in exploring impact of social behavior on systems and organizational behaviors. This technique is used in fields of life science, social science, organizational behavior, and cognition."

,"This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of marketing and has been designed especially for the students in the Raikes School. The course is taught in a modular format by a team of three instructors – Dr. Ravi Sohi, Dr. Dwayne Ball, and Mr. Rob Simon. The first module taught by Mr. Simon, provides an overview of the contemporary concepts in marketing. Student learn the elements of the marketing mix and how to use these elements to develop and implement marketing strategies. In the second module taught by Dr. Ball, students are introduced to tools and techniques for analyzing large customer databases. Large data is transforming business and these tools enable marketers to analyze the data and develop products and services to meet the needs of customers. The third module taught by Dr. Sohi, focuses on e-marketing. Students are introduced to e-marketing frameworks and use these to identify a market opportunity and develop a business model and plan for an e-business. A major focus of this course is on applied learning and to achieve this, students analyze several cases, engage in mini-projects, participate in a simulation game, and develop a business plan for an e-business that requires them to integrate concepts learned in all three modules."

,"About the Course: Innovation and Model Thinking IV introduces game theoretic models to describe behavior.  Models are developed with particular reference to innovation.  Students learn about simultaneous and ordered move games and modeling game trees.  Games of innovation and diffusion are considered, as well as games modeling other strategic decisions.  Consumer behavior is explored, especially with respect to uncertainty, product choice, and their impact on new product diffusion.   Models of product location and product differentiation are considered as well.
"
,"
This course also adds a variety of topics relevant to the innovation process.  Legal aspects such as intellectual property law, form of a new organization, and antitrust law are discussed.  Other startup topics such as differences in organizational structure and innovation constraints are considered when innovation occurs within an existing company versus a startup."

I have been teaching accounting for over 15 years. After graduating with my Master's, I worked in public accounting. Then, in the early 90's, my husband and I joined the Peace Corps and served in Russia. I began teaching upon our return.

                Students in the Jeffrey S. Raikes School live in the Kauffman Center, in the heart of ,, across from Broyhill Fountain and the Nebraska Union. Through a gift from Carole and Ed McVaney in honor of her mother Esther Kauffman, this beautiful new building lets students live and learn in an environment that supports their vibrant academic community.

                The Great Hall, meeting rooms and study rooms let students settle in for spur-of-the-moment study sessions, have workshops and presentations, find a quiet place to sit with a laptop and answer e-mail or finish a report, or watch a movie, have an Xbox 360 tournament or a late night snack feast. Some classes are in Kauffman, but others are outside, across campus, giving a mix of convenience (run downstairs to a 7 a.m. meeting in sweats) and expansiveness (meet classmates at CBA, for business class, play Frisbee football in the Union green space, or head off to the Rec Center for pick-up basketball).

,"This class introduces students to the research topic of multiagent systems (MAS), including what a MAS is, what agents are, and what are the disadvantages and advantages of such a system in what types of applications.  It presents some background issues in distributed problem solving (e.g., constraint satisfaction) and planning (e.g., optimization) and build on the noncooperative game theory.  It then looks into learning in multiagent systems and agent communication.  Also covers formal agent topics such as social choice, mechanism design, auctions, and coalitional game theory.  Students will also practice and better understand MAS topics through a variety of game days, a simulation-based final project, and online collaborative Wiki."

,"Mastery: The objective of this class is for the students to master the knowledge required to design and build a useful multiagent system, from specifications of the problem domains to the choice on a particular type of multiagent system, from conceptual design to the details on what particular choices to use (such as the communication and coordination protocols), and from describing the environment parameters of a system to the characteristics of each agent."
,"Familiarity: The objective of this class is to familiarize students with various aspects of a multiagent system: fundamental issues, the current research focus, the technologies available, the evaluation criteria, and the applications. Moreover, this class aims to familiarize students with the notion of an agent and the refreshing programming paradigm of multiagent systems: how it is different from other paradigms, and how to best make use of the paradigm. "
,"Finally, this class aims to familiarize students with the idea of simulating real-world behaviors and decision making in an environment of agents. Exposure: The objective of this class is to expose students to other important areas of Artificial Intelligence such as search, planning, and knowledge representation, in general. In particular, it also exposes students to research issues and applications in emergent behavior and SWARMS, as well as the research and education efforts in Robocup and related contests."

            In Design Studio, we integrate agile engineering processes, lean business development, and interdisciplinary design thinking into an iterative process for problem solving and product development. Our iterative development methodologies lead to the development of robust software products that address real problems and provide elegant, human-centered, solutions. Throughout the process, Design Studio teams are mentored by industry professionals from the community, helping teams more effectively communicate, overcome technical challenges, and drive innovation for their partners.
        "

            Our process allows us to work with a range of technologies and platforms; in Design Studio it is always about solving the problem and never about using a preferred technology. By focusing on solution-oriented development, our teams are able leverage any technology necessary to provide the right solution for a problem. Design Studio teams have completed projects and are comfortable using:
        "
,"
                    Teams in Design Studio focus development efforts around a release schedule that is coordinated across each of the teams; everyone in Design Studio is working towards common and measurable goals and sharing success. During the 2-semester Design Studio project year, teams will delivery results of their work to project sponsors 6 times. By working towards milestones that are aligned with release points, teams are focused on prioritization based on demonstrable progress that is user and not technology focused. At each release point, sponsors have something that they can get in front of stakeholders to actually use, resulting in valuable feedback that the teams can incorporate into subsequent releases.
                "
,"
                    In Design Studio, student teams self select. During the summer, faculty assign a team Product Manager and Development Manager who work with the project sponsor to develop a scope of work. In the first week of September, the team leads will select their team members in a draft-style team selection process; creating buy-in across the entire team. Teams will then begin development sprints leading to 3 product releases each semester; in early October, early November, mid December, early February, mid March, and late April. Final hand off of the product will take place after a +1 iteration in early May. Between releases teams work in 2 week sprints and meet weekly with project stakeholders to make sure that the right people are involved and that there is full transparency to the process. The two the three sprint release-cycle helps to ensure that students are focused, stakeholders are involved, and projects remain on track.

                        In Design Studio, we integrate agile engineering processes, lean business development, and
                        interdisciplinary design thinking into an iterative process for problem solving and product
                        development - our unique brand of innovation. Our iterative development methodologies lead to
                        the development of robust software products that address real problems and provide elegant
                        solutions. Throughout the process, Design Studio teams are mentored by industry professionals
                        from the community, helping teams more effectively communicate, overcome technical challenges,
                        and drive innovation for their partners.
